### Brain Entropy and Altered States

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let’s talk about *brain entropy*.

We’re finding that the *entropy* (or complexity/unpredictability) of spontaneous brain activity—measured via EEG or MEG—*correlates with the intensity of the altered state*.

Psychedelics increase brain entropy. This is particularly evident under DMT, where participants describe extraordinarily rich and vivid experiences. When we asked people to rate the richness of their experience after receiving intravenous DMT, their scores correlated with the degree of entropy we measured in their EEG.

We also found that *increased brain entropy predicted psychological insight*, which, as I noted earlier, predicts therapeutic outcomes.

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
So this may be a *key neural index* of the psychedelic experience itself.

Think of it as the *“opening of the reducing valve”* (to use Aldous Huxley’s metaphor). Brain entropy reflects how much the mind is opening up. It’s a readout of plasticity—a window of opportunity.

That doesn't mean it tells you how effective the therapy will be. But it tells you *how strongly the drug is acting on the brain*.
