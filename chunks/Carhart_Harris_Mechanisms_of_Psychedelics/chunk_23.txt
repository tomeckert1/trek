### Final Reflections
  
**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
So that’s the arc. From receptors and plasticity, to ego dissolution and belief relaxation, to real-world clinical outcomes.

These are still early days, but I believe psychedelics act on a *core dimension of human brain organization*—and that’s why they have such unique potential.

Thank you for your attention.

**Erica Zelfand:**
Thank you so much, Robin. That was extraordinary. I have pages of notes.

Let’s go to participant questions.

### Q&A Highlights

**Tal Sharabi:**
Robin, what are your thoughts on *rescue medications*—blockers or antagonists used to abort difficult psychedelic experiences?

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Good question. Some studies are exploring this. MindMed recently sponsored work using a 2A antagonist post-LSD to reduce effects. There are also benzodiazepines, which can abort a session, but they don’t align with the *therapeutic model of working through difficulty*. Rescue meds should be *last-resort options* for acute risk or agitation.

**A student:**
Can psychedelics cause *long-term harm* to the nervous system or brain?

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Not to our knowledge. Classic psychedelics are *non-neurotoxic*. If anything, they appear to support *synaptic growth* and *neural repair*—the opposite of what we see with stress. But we need more long-term data to confirm.

**A student:**
Are there parallels between *psilocybin and lion’s mane* regarding neuroplasticity?

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Interesting question, but not my area. That’s more in the *nootropics* or *nutraceuticals* space—someone like Paul Stamets would have more to say.

**A student:**
What about *psychedelics with adolescents*? Are there concerns?

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Yes—age matters. Younger people are more prone to persistent perceptual changes (HPPD). But some traditions involve adolescent use, and in clinical contexts, this may be reasonable with proper support. It’s a matter of *risk, timing, and containment*. MAPS is looking into MDMA for adolescents with PTSD.

**Erica Zelfand:**
What’s your favorite psychedelic?

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Psilocybin, of course.

Though MDMA is... quite nice.
