### Expectancy Effects and Placebo

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
We also explored *expectancy effects*—how much people believed a treatment would help.

Expectancy predicted response to *escitalopram*, but *not* to psilocybin.

This suggests that the placebo effect may be *less central* to psilocybin’s action.

Of course, we need more research, including studies on *suggestibility*, to fully understand this dynamic.
