### Predicting Positive Outcomes

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Now let’s flip the question: *What predicts positive outcomes?*

Some early signals include:
- *High agreeableness* (versus traits associated with personality disorders)
- *High trait absorption* (the ability to be immersed in art, music, nature, etc.)
- *Supportive emotional and environmental settings*
- *Community and connection (Communitas)*
- *Good rapport and trust*
- *Readiness to let go*
- *Therapeutic intentions*
- *Willingness to surrender*
- *Emotional breakthrough*

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let me highlight *Communitas*, an especially powerful concept.

We found that *shared humanity and togetherness* during group psychedelic experiences predicted *better outcomes* than anything else we’ve ever measured in our data.

Janis Kettner, now at UCSF, developed a *Communitas Scale* to track this. Her study (Kettner et al., ~2020) is a must-read if you're interested in group work with psychedelics.

The takeaway: *Connection heals*—sometimes more than any individual insight.
