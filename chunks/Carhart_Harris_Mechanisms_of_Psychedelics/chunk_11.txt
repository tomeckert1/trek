### Plasticity and the “Inner Healer”

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
This model also resonates with ideas like the *“inner healer”*—the notion that, under the right conditions, people know how to heal themselves.

If psychedelics create a *plastic, open state*, and if the person's default state is somewhat deformed or rigid, then the brain might self-correct under those conditions—especially with the right therapeutic support.

This doesn’t negate suffering or complexity, but it points to a fundamental possibility of healing.

So again: *psychedelics unlock plasticity*, and *context guides that plasticity* toward integration or disruption.
