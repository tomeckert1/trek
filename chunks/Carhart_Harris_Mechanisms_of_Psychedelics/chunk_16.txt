### Functional Brain Imaging and Psychedelics

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Using fMRI, we’ve visualized the effects of psychedelics on *brain network communication*.

This famous image—sometimes seen as street art—shows how *psilocybin increases communication between normally segregated brain systems*. Regions that usually talk only within their own networks start talking across boundaries.

We’ve seen this:
- Under *LSD*, with increased connectivity between the visual cortex and the rest of the brain (correlating with visual hallucinations)
- Under *DMT*, with similar disruption of hierarchical networks

These effects are suggestive of *ego dissolution*. If the sense of self is encoded in high-level networks, and those networks are disrupted or decoupled, then the self, as we know it, dissolves.

So psychedelics teach us not just about drugs—but about the *nature of consciousness itself*.
