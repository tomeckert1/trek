### REBUS – Relaxed Beliefs under Psychedelics

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Another conceptual model I developed is called *REBUS*:  
*Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics*.

It’s based on *predictive coding*, a theory of brain function which says the brain is a hierarchical prediction machine. It constantly models the world, both external and internal.

High-level beliefs sit at the top of this hierarchy and exert *top-down influence*—they shape perception, emotion, and behavior.

Psychedelics appear to *relax the precision of these top-down beliefs*. They weaken their grip. This allows new bottom-up information to enter and reshape the model.

In other words: psychedelics temporarily dismantle our most rigid assumptions about self, world, and meaning.

This helps explain phenomena like:
- *Ego dissolution*
- *Emotional catharsis*
- *Breakthrough insight*

We even see this in optical illusions: under psychedelics, these illusions don’t work as well—because the brain isn’t imposing the same top-down predictions.

### Reversing the Predictive Flow – Bottom-Up Information

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
In EEG studies, we measured *directional information flow* in the brain—top-down versus bottom-up.

Under normal conditions, there’s a dominant top-down flow. But under DMT, we saw that flow *flip*—bottom-up signals became dominant.

It’s similar to what happens when you go from *eyes closed to eyes open*—the brain becomes more receptive to new input.

This flipping of information flow may be a neural signature of *psychedelic insight*, and of the reorganization that follows.

### Measuring Belief Change

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
We also measured changes in *self-related beliefs* using a validated scale.

We found that after a high-dose psilocybin session:
- *Negative self-beliefs decreased significantly*
- This effect *endured* for at least a month
- These changes correlated with *increases in brain entropy*

In other words, the more the brain opened up, the more negative self-concepts were released—and the longer those changes lasted.

This is compelling evidence for a therapeutic mechanism: *relaxing rigid self-models under high-entropy states*.
