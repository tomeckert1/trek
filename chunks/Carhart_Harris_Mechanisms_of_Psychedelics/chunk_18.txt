### Axial Diffusivity and White Matter Changes

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Here’s a new and *unpublished* finding I’m excited about.

We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to look at white matter structure in the brain. Specifically, we tracked *axial diffusivity*, a measure of how easily water moves along neural fibers—basically, how “tight” or “organized” those cables are.

We found that:
- One month after a *high dose* of psilocybin (25 mg), *axial diffusivity decreased*
- This resembles patterns seen in *brain development* (e.g., from infancy to adulthood)
- It’s the *opposite* of what happens in aging, where diffusivity increases due to fiber degradation

This suggests that psilocybin may *enhance brain maturation* or *promote healthy structural change*.

Participants also showed improved psychological well-being and increased *cognitive flexibility* after the session.

So it’s an exciting result—but of course, it needs replication.

**Erica Zelfand:**
Robin, could you just clarify that for folks newer to neuroscience? You’re saying that axial diffusivity usually decreases as the brain develops, right?

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Yes, exactly. From infancy to adulthood, *diffusivity decreases* as white matter pathways become more organized.

In aging, the opposite happens—*diffusivity increases*, signaling breakdown.

So the decrease we saw one month after psilocybin looks like a *healthy, developmental shift*, not a pathological one.

**Erica Zelfand:**
So could this suggest an anti-aging or anti-dementia potential?

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
You said it, not me. *[laughter]*

It’s tempting to imagine the headlines—“Psilocybin: The Elixir of Life”—but we need to manage expectations.

Still, it's a fascinating possibility.
