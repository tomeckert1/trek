### Stress, Plasticity, and the Role of the 2A Receptor

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let’s zoom out for a moment. We’ve established that the 2A receptor promotes plasticity. The next question is: *When and why would an organism need plasticity?*

One answer is: *during adversity or stress*.

There’s considerable evidence that *chronic stress upregulates the serotonin 2A receptor system*:
- It increases the availability of 2A receptors.
- It increases receptor affinity.
- It boosts serotonin release, especially under acute stress.

In other words, *stress engages the very system that psychedelics target*.

That’s a powerful insight. It suggests that psychedelics may be hijacking a natural stress-adaptation system—one that evolved to increase plasticity under difficult conditions, so the organism could adapt, learn, and change.

### The Pivotal Mental States Model

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
That leads us to the idea of *“pivotal mental states”*—transient periods of *hyperplasticity* during which transformation becomes possible.

These states can be triggered by psychedelics, but also by trauma, grief, or peak life events. The term captures the *window of opportunity* when the mind is particularly open to change.

We laid out this model in a paper called *Pivotal Mental States*. It explores the phenomenology and psychology of these states, and makes the case that psychedelics induce them reliably and safely.
