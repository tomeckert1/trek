### Lasting Changes – Post-Acute Brain Effects

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
What about *after the trip*?

We’ve looked at psilocybin for depression using fMRI, and found *lasting changes* in the brain.

Specifically, *brain modularity*—a measure of how compartmentalized the brain is—*decreased after treatment*. That suggests increased *global communication* persisted even after the acute effects wore off.

This held true in:
- Our *treatment-resistant depression trial*
- Our *major depressive disorder trial*

And the more modularity decreased, the more symptoms improved. So we may be seeing a *carryover of the acute brain effects into the post-acute state*.

### Flattening the Attractor Landscape

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
This connects to a helpful metaphor: the *“attractor landscape.”*

Imagine your psychological state space as a landscape with grooves or canals. In depression or other mental illness, these grooves can become deep—*too easy to fall into, too hard to escape from*.

Psychedelics seem to *flatten the landscape*. Under drug, the mind becomes more flexible. After drug, the landscape *partially re-forms*, but remains *less rigid* than before.

That’s the model: a window of flexibility, followed by a more open and adaptive baseline.
