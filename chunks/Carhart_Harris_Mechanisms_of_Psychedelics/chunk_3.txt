### Introduction

**Erica Zelfand:**
So without further ado, I'm going to introduce our speaker.

Robin Carhart-Harris is the Ralph Metzner Distinguished Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). He's also a founding director of UCSF's Neuroscape Psychedelics Division. Having previously headed the Center for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, Robin is a pioneer of psychedelic science. He has published over one hundred papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals. If you hop into Google and search for "psychedelic research," you're going to find a paper—or many—by him.

We’re really delighted to have him joining us tonight. Robin, I’ll hand it over to you.

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Thank you, Erica. Thanks to the InnerTrek team for having me here.

I'm delighted to contribute. I was lucky enough to be asked to contribute to the Oregon initiative early on, so I got to watch it grow and evolve—and succeed. I'm so pleased to be continuing to contribute, and I’m excited, like all of you, about the future and where this is going.
