### Emotional Breakthrough and Psychological Insight

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
One model we've developed focuses on *emotional breakthrough*.

We created the Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI)—a short six-item scale measuring emotional catharsis or release during dosing sessions.

We found that the intensity of this emotional release predicted better therapeutic outcomes.

In a follow-up study, we introduced another measure: the *Psychological Insight Scale*, which tracks insight one day after the session.

What we found:
- *Emotional breakthrough during the session* →  
- *Insight the next day* →  
- *Improved well-being*

So this sequence seems to form a *key pathway to therapeutic success*.
