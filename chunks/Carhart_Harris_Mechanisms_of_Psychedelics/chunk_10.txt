### A New Model of Psychopathology – Canalization

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Lately, I’ve been developing a *conceptual model of mental illness* inspired by what we’ve seen in psychedelic therapy.

The idea is: if psychedelics seem to work across many different conditions, then maybe they’re acting on something *common* to those conditions. What is that common thread?

We propose that it’s a kind of *psychological entrenchment*—rigid patterns of thought or behavior that have become stamped into the psyche. These patterns form a sort of “deformation” in one’s psychological state space, making it easy to fall into and hard to escape from.

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
There’s a useful term for this: *canalization*.

The term was introduced by evolutionary biologist Conrad Waddington, inspired by the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead and Henri Bergson’s concept of the élan vital.

Canalization describes how certain traits or behaviors become *fixed* over time—resistant to change. In the brain, this could mean that certain neural pathways become too well-trodden. In psychology, it could mean ruminative thinking in depression, or behavioral loops in addiction.

In this model:
- *Adversity triggers defensive rigidity.*
- That rigidity becomes entrenched—canalized.

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- Mental illness is the overshooting of that adaptive response.

So if that’s the *problem*, then the *solution* is plasticity—softening those rigid grooves, allowing for new possibilities.

That’s what psychedelics may be doing.
