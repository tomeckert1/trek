### The Role of Therapeutic Rapport

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Another key factor: *therapeutic rapport*.

We measured this with a simple item on the day of the session:  
*"I have a good relationship with the person or people supporting me during this experience."*

Strong rapport was strongly predictive of emotional breakthroughâ€”and, in turn, symptom improvement.

Common sense? Perhaps. But these models help us formally *track and validate the mechanisms of change*, and they give us something to optimize for in treatment protocols.
