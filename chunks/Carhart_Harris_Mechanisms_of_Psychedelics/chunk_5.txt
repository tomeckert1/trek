### What Does the 2A Receptor Actually Do?

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
So if this receptor is so important, what does it actually *do*?

Much of what we know about the 2A receptor comes from broader serotonin research, not just psychedelic studies. The serotonin system has been extensively studied since the 1940s.

We know serotonin is involved in:
- *Brain development*
- *Neuroplasticity* (the ability of the brain to change)
- *Learning and adaptation*

More recently, we discovered that the 2A receptor plays a role in very *early brain development*—even in the embryonic brain. Stimulating 2A receptors in animal embryos was shown to influence cortical development. In more evolved species (including humans), this action was more pronounced.

This suggests that 2A receptor signaling may be a key player in *cortical expansion*—how the human brain became what it is. So this idea sort of echoes the “Stoned Ape Hypothesis,” though here it's framed more in terms of the receptor itself being relevant to brain evolution, not necessarily psychedelics as agents of evolution.

So the 2A receptor is involved in early brain growth—and also in *adult brain plasticity*.

### Psychedelics and Synaptic Growth

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
More recently, we’ve seen compelling evidence that psychedelics increase markers of *anatomical neuroplasticity*.

When neurons are exposed to psychedelics, they grow more dendritic spines—tiny protrusions that form synapses and allow neurons to communicate. These structural changes happen especially in the cortex, where the 2A receptors are most concentrated.

In live animal studies, a single dose of psilocybin produced rapid spine growth that lasted over a month. That’s remarkable. It mirrors the *rapid and enduring symptom improvements* we see in psychedelic therapy.

So the theme here is: *2A receptor activity promotes plasticity*, both in early development and in adult brains.

And that plasticity isn’t just neural—it extends to the *mind* and *behavior*.
