### Integration – A Critical Gap

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
We believe that *integration practices* are key to outcomes, but they haven’t been well-measured in clinical research.

We’ve developed a scale to assess integration and hope to use it in future studies. The goal is to determine which practices (e.g., mindfulness, community support, journaling) actually promote *resilience and long-term transformation*.

There’s strong clinical intuition around integration, particularly in underground settings—but we need to back that up with formal data.

This could be the next major step in improving outcomes and reducing relapse.
