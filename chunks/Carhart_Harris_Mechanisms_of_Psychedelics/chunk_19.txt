### Psychedelics and a Core Organizational Principle of the Human Brain

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let’s return to the big picture.

Across multiple brain measures, we keep seeing a *repeating pattern*: psychedelics act most strongly on *high-level transmodal cortex*—the part of the brain responsible for abstract thought, self-awareness, and long-range integration.

This same region shows up in:
- Maps of *2A receptor density*
- Areas of *human brain expansion* (compared to primates)
- Networks with *long-range connections*
- Areas with *greater plasticity*
- Regions involved in *semantic processing*, *self-related thought*, and *slow fluctuations in consciousness*

The point is this: psychedelics *consistently affect the most uniquely human aspects of the brain*.

This may help explain why their effects are so profound, and why they can be both transformative and destabilizing.
