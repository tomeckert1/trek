### Psilocybin vs. Escitalopram (SSRI) – Clinical Trial Findings

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let’s talk about our *head-to-head trial*: psilocybin vs. escitalopram (Lexapro), a common SSRI.

*Design:*
- *Psilocybin arm*: Two 25 mg sessions, three weeks apart
- *SSRI arm*: Daily escitalopram (10 mg → 20 mg) for six weeks
- Matched for therapist time and daily placebo capsules

*Results:*
- On the primary outcome (QIDS), there was *no significant difference*
- But on *all other secondary measures*, psilocybin outperformed escitalopram

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Had we chosen a different primary outcome, the headlines would’ve read very differently:  
*“Psilocybin Superior to Gold Standard Antidepressant”*

We also developed a custom measure to assess *positive emotional capacities*, and found that psilocybin significantly enhanced:
- Emotional depth
- Compassion
- Creative thinking
- Pleasure
- Crying
- Concentration

These are aspects of emotionality that SSRIs often *dull*.

In fact, brain imaging showed that escitalopram *blunted emotional reactivity* to facial expressions, while psilocybin *preserved or even enhanced it*.
