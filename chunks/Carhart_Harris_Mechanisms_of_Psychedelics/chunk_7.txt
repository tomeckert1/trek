### Clinical Trials – Promising Outcomes

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let’s turn to the data.

Numerous clinical trials on psilocybin therapy have now shown:
- *Rapid and enduring improvements* in symptoms.
- *Transdiagnostic effects*—benefits across multiple disorders.
- The importance of *context* (set and setting).
- That psychedelic therapy is a *process*, not a one-off drug event.

All the major clinical trials have *positively manipulated context*:
- Music is always included.

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- Two guides or facilitators are present throughout dosing sessions.
- Preparation and integration are structured and emphasized.

This is essential to understand: psychedelic therapy is not drug-only. It’s a *combination treatment*. The drug induces a state of plasticity—and what you do with that state determines the outcome.

So this reinforces the value of setting a *positive therapeutic container*.
