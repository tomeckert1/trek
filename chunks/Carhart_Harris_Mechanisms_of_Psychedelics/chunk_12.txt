### Predicting Outcomes – Risk and Resilience Factors

**Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Here’s a schematic model of change. Some elements are backed by strong evidence; others are more speculative.

*Risk Factors (Associated with Negative Outcomes):*
- *Young age*: Associated with higher rates of HPPD (hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder).
- *Low socioeconomic status*: Seen in SSRI studies as a risk factor for poor outcomes.
- *Personality disorders*: Individuals with a diagnosis of personality disorder were 4x more likely to experience decreases in well-being after psychedelic use (based on survey data).
- *Avoidant attachment style*
- *Current life stress*
- *Lack of rapport or trust*
- *Resistance to letting go*
- *Escapist intentions*
- *Polydrug use*
- *High or poorly calibrated doses*

These are all factors we need to better understand, especially if we aim to mitigate risk in psychedelic care.
