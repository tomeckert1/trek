### Co-Creating a New Field: Between the Ancient and the Emerging

**Simon Yugler:**
Thank you again, everyone, for the reflections.  
This conversation has been incredibly rich. I’ll close with a few final thoughts — things I’ve been reflecting on as we sit at the intersection of ancient traditions and an emerging modern field.

We’re not doing something entirely new… but we are creating something new.  
We stand at the crossroads between the past and the future, and we’re being asked to carry both.

### Key Principles for Moving Forward Respectfully

**Simon Yugler:**
Here are some reflections — things I’ve heard from Indigenous elders, mentors, and my own lived experience:

*We’re not here to replicate the past*
We’re not trying to reenact Mazatec rituals. That would veer into appropriation.  
We’re called to *create something rooted and respectful* for the culture we actually live in.

*Approach with a non-extractive mindset*
Psilocybin is not endangered or culturally scarce — it’s widespread and grows easily.  

**Simon Yugler:**
This gives us an opportunity to create *non-extractive, sustainable* models.

*Embrace science *and* spirit*
We can speak the language of science — research, neurobiology, psychology — while honoring the deeper cultural and spiritual layers.  
These are not mutually exclusive.

*Integrate multiple modalities*
Modern healing modalities — psychotherapy, psychiatry, neuroscience, somatics, etc. — can coexist with Indigenous and ancestral wisdom.  

We don’t need to choose one “right” way.
