### Generalized Western Healing Context

**Simon Yugler:**
Let’s talk about our modern Western context of healing.

A lot of you already named some key pieces of this in your responses.  
In modern medicine, healing is often reduced to lifeless chemicals — molecules in a lab. Medicine is seen as an inanimate substance, devoid of spirit or intelligence.

Healing is also an isolated act. So much so that we’ve built a whole web of legal precedent and protective laws around the therapist-client or doctor-patient relationship — emphasizing privacy and secrecy. That’s intended to be protective, but it also speaks volumes about how we culturally relate to healing.

As Mario mentioned earlier, we’re immersed in a worldview often called *rational materialism*.  That’s the default — we treat reality, including health and illness, as chemical, molecular, observable phenomena.

Take depression, for example. We had the “chemical imbalance” theory. It’s now been debunked — even by the psychiatric establishment. But that’s a rational-materialist idea of mental illness.

And I hear this all the time, especially from clients in Jamaica:  
> “I’m here to take psilocybin to reset my Default Mode Network.”  
Or,  

> “I need to reset my neurotransmitters.”

And like... okay. Those may be downstream effects of psilocybin. I don’t necessarily disagree. But when that’s the *only* frame — when someone’s openness stops at the neurotransmitter level — I often see the experience not go the way they expect. That’s just my observation.

### Stigma Against Altered States

**Simon Yugler:**
Let’s name the huge stigma our culture holds around altered states of consciousness. We’re 54 years into the “War on Drugs.”  Thank you, Richard Nixon — Happy Birthday in June.

That’s the U.S., but if we zoom out to Western Europe and Christian traditions, this stigma has been going on for centuries. There’s been a long, cultural devaluation of non-ordinary states and plant medicines in general.

So we’re walking into this work with all of that — decades and centuries of cultural baggage.
