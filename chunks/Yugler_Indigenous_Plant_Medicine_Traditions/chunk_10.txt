### Final Reflections and Q&A

**Simon Yugler:**
We’ve got about ten minutes left, and I see a bunch of questions coming in. Let’s dive in.

### Slido Reflections & Community Insights

**Mario (Moderator):**
We’ve had great contributions coming through Slido. Here are a few we’d like to lift up:

- *Damian Palmer:* Reflects on the inherent tension between operating under capitalism and avoiding appropriation or commodification.  
- *Signe Lindeman:* Suggests that the same substance can be a medicine, medication, or drug — depending on intent, frequency, and purpose.  
- *Phoenix Anu:* Proposes that a "medicine" is taken without a script, a "medication" with a script, and a "drug" for recreation.  
- *Luis Medina:* Envisions a new field where science and the mystical coexist — not one or the other, but both.

### Live Sharing: Eric’s Perspective

**Eric:**
I want to stir the pot a bit. It feels like we’ve taken something sacred — these Indigenous plant medicines — and we’ve had to strip it down to make it fit into a capitalist system.  
There’s a danger in losing the miraculous power of these traditions in favor of something commodified, clinical, and palatable for the mainstream.

**Simon Yugler:**
Thank you. And I think the best way to ensure we don’t lose sight of these truths… is for *you* not to lose sight of them. Hold onto what roots you in this work — your reverence, your stories, your connection. That’s what your clients will feel.

### Practitioners as Bridge Walkers

**Samantha:**
To Eric’s point — and Jay’s earlier — yes, we have to work with legislators. We have to speak the language of policy and research. But we also must speak the language of spirit, of healing, of reverence. As facilitators, we carry both worlds. That’s our responsibility.

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly. For me, that means speaking in the language of depth psychology, myth, and culture.  But each of you will find your own way.  
*Your authentic voice matters.*

### Ancestral Threads

**Jayanti:**
I was fascinated by the map showing psilocybin mushroom species around the world.  
It made me wonder — what happened to the traditions in Europe and India? Were they obliterated before they could reach us?  
I’m curious to explore those threads in my ancestry — I’ve been on a yogic path for decades and want to see what might be hidden there.

**Simon Yugler:**
Beautiful question. And I’ll point you toward a great book: *The Immortality Key* — it explores the use of psychedelics in ancient Greece and early Christianity.  
There’s a whole lineage waiting to be uncovered.

### Closing & Acknowledgments

**Simon Yugler:**
That’s all I’ve got for tonight.  
Thank you all so much — for your openness, for the respectful dialogue, for your thoughtful questions.

*Special thanks* to:
- Mario and Oneiros for moderating so beautifully  
- Tom, Nate, Lisa, and the whole InnerTrek team

**Tom (InnerTrek):**
Let’s close in our usual way — switching to gallery view and waving goodnight.  
See you next week. Same time, same place.
