### Indigenous-Inspired Lessons for Facilitators

**Simon Yugler:**
These are principles I’ve internalized from time spent with Indigenous elders and teachers, and I offer them to you as guiding values:

*1. Apprenticeship takes time*
Traditionally, to become a curandero or ayahuasquero might require years — even a full year of dieta in isolation as a baseline.  
This is sacred work. It takes time, humility, and dedication.

*2. Healing happens in community*
Facilitation isn’t a solo endeavor. Community is a key container.  
Healing is relational — with others, with nature, with spirit.

*3. Elders are sacred*
Look for mentors and elders in this work — Indigenous or otherwise.  
Value lived experience, intergenerational wisdom, and lineage.

*4. Do your own work*
Learn from the medicine itself.  
Experience it. Integrate it.  
Your clients will connect to you before they connect to the medicine.

*5. Cultivate your own medicine*
You are not just delivering psilocybin.  
You are the medicine* too — your presence, your integrity, your wholeness.

*6. Bring your own life into balance*
Clean up your side of the street.  
What you carry into the room matters.  
Your nervous system, your grounding, your clarity — it all transmits.

*7. Explore your ancestry*
Where are your people from?  
What practices and ceremonies have been forgotten?  
Connect to your roots — this helps keep you from unconsciously appropriating someone else’s.

*8. Feed the holy*
What feeds life?  
What brings beauty into the world?  

In the words of Martin Prechtel: “Feed the holy.”  
This is about reverence, reciprocity, and relational wholeness — beyond just the human realm.
