### Concerns From Indigenous Communities

**Simon Yugler:**
- *Colonial and extractionary practices.*  
  A classic example is turning sacred coca into cocaine — a plant revered in the Andes for millennia, made into a substance of harm by outsiders.

- *Technological commodification.*  
  A friend of mine recently wrote about *psilocybin vapes* — yes, that’s a thing. They don’t even contain real psilocybin. This kind of gimmickry is deeply worrying. It mirrors the extractive thinking we just discussed.

- *Exclusion from the conversation.*  
  Indigenous communities are being left out — of research, policy, partnerships, and leadership in this field. That’s a huge red flag.

- *Cultural legitimacy and legality.*  
  Many traditional uses remain criminalized or delegitimized, while corporations build wealth off those same practices.

- *Overharvesting and ecological harm.*  
  As demand grows, some natural medicines like peyote are becoming endangered.

- *Unqualified facilitators causing harm.*  
  With the rising popularity, there are more people serving medicine without proper training, lineage, or ethical grounding.

So, in sum: there are real, complex tensions here.

### A Collective Responsibility

**Simon Yugler:**
What do we do with all of this?

What does this moment ask of us — as aspiring or practicing facilitators?

I have my own answers, but I’d rather hear from you first.

- What does this evoke in you?
- What are you wondering about?
- What do you feel called to respond to?
