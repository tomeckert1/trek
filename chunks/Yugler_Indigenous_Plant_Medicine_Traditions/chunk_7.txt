Let’s hear from the group.

### Community Reflections

**Munai:**
I felt a burning, tingling call to speak.  
To me, this is about responsibility — choosing what side of history we want to be on.  
Are we contributing to cycles of exploitation and harm, or are we remembering the Earth, the good medicine, and our true nature?

**Simon Yugler:**
Thank you. Yes. Beautifully said.

**Tamara:**
The word that came up for me over and over again was *reverence*.  
Reverence for the medicine, for the ancestors, and for the cultures who have kept these traditions alive.

**Simon Yugler:**
Absolutely. Reverence is so needed.

**Tanner:**
What’s coming up for me is *stewardship*.  
We’re in a moment where many hands are reaching toward this medicine — some with good intentions, some not.  Being among the first legal facilitators in the U.S. is a huge responsibility. We need to hold the sacred, anchor it, and build a culture that respects the deeper roots.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes. Stewardship. That’s such a meaningful word in this work.

### Grounding the Conversation in Practical Reality

**Jay:**
Let’s get real. When we talk to legislators, they don’t want to hear about spirit animals and dreamtime. They want to hear about PTSD, depression, anxiety — measurable things. You can’t go to the legislature with mystical language. They’ll laugh at you.

**Simon Yugler:**
I appreciate that pragmatic perspective.  There’s a lot of focus on research for a reason. We’ve had to prove this medicine’s validity against centuries of stigma — and scientific research helps us do that. It may be a narrow lens, but it’s necessary for legal and public legitimacy.

### A Broader Context: Expanding the Narrative

**Mario (Moderator):**
Yes. Jay, thank you.  
What we’re doing here by elevating Indigenous perspectives is expanding the dominant narrative. Psychedelic medicines operate differently in different contexts — cultural cosmologies shape how healing is understood.

It’s not about replacing one view with another, but about adding dimension. If we only sit with the dominant, Western lens, we miss something essential.

### Cannabis Industry as a Cautionary Tale

**Trevor:**
Hearing all of this reminds me of what happened with cannabis.  
A friend of mine is in the cannabis processing industry, and honestly, what’s going on there is disturbing — lots of commercialization and loss of integrity.

Psilocybin isn’t cannabis, but the forces of capitalism are strong. We need to look at what happened with cannabis as a cautionary tale.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes. So true. I’ve seen people try to apply the business model of cannabis to psilocybin, and it doesn’t work. Psilocybin is not cannabis — energetically, culturally, or clinically. It’s a different being entirely.

### Storytelling, Myth, and the Opportunity of This Moment

**Natalie:**
I’ve been thinking a lot about story and myth.  One of the most amazing things about psychedelics is they speak to us in our own symbolic language.  So how do we tell a story — a new mythology — that honors lineage and brings something whole into this new Western legal framework?

This moment is such an opportunity. There’s risk, yes, but also a huge chance to bring spiritual wholeness into clinical settings.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes. This is something I write about in my book and we’ll talk more about during the integration phase of the program.  
Thank you for that reflection — beautifully said.

### Wrapping Up This Section

**Mario:**
Simon, it’s 9:05 — we have about 25 minutes left in the session. Do you have more to share?

**Simon Yugler:**
I have a little more, but not 25 minutes worth. Let’s hear from two more participants, then I’ll close the presentation and we’ll open up to questions.

**Asher:**
I’ve been thinking about the importance of *consent* in our relationship with altered states.  In Western culture, people are often imprisoned or hospitalized for experiences that resemble altered states — without consent. I’d hate to see that happen with psilocybin — that it be forced on someone without full understanding.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes. That’s a powerful point.  
In facilitation, it’s our responsibility to ensure informed consent — that people know what they’re stepping into. That’s part of ethical preparation, which we’ll cover in depth later in the program.

**Olivia:**
As legal, licensed psilocybin facilitators, we hold *privilege*.  
That gives us a platform and a voice that many underground or Indigenous healers don’t have.  It’s our responsibility to use that platform — to advocate, protect, and keep the medicine accessible and sacred.

**Simon Yugler:**
Thank you. Yes. This idea of professional identity — of stepping into this work publicly — is a theme we’ll revisit toward the end of our training. It’s something to hold with reverence.
