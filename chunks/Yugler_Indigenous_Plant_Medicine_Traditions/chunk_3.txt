### Introduction of Simon Yugler

**Mario Alonso Cordero Martinez:**

It’s a great honor to introduce Simon Yugler, who is leading our first Wednesday class.

Simon is a psychedelic therapist, educator, and the author of *Psychedelics and the Soul: A Mythic Guide to Psychedelic Healing, Depth Psychology, and Cultural Repair*. He holds a Master’s in Depth Psychology from Pacifica Graduate Institute and has taught for five psychedelic facilitator training programs, including Naropa University and InnerTrek.

Simon has traveled extensively and learned from indigenous traditions, including the Shipibo Ayahuasca lineage and the Native American Church. He also spent over a year as a retreat leader and therapist at MycoMeditations, a renowned psilocybin therapy retreat in Jamaica.

Before becoming a therapist, Simon worked as an experiential educator and guide for young adults in over ten countries through National Geographic Student Expeditions.

He integrates Jungian psychology, mythology, and animistic perspectives to help people explore the “liminal wilds of the soul.” A perfect guide for tonight’s topic: *Indigenous Plant Medicine Traditions*.

In our journey to become psilocybin facilitators, it's essential we understand that generations before us have built relationships with these sacred plants — through ritual, mythology, song, and other "archaic techniques of ecstasy." My own research has focused on the Mazatec cosmology of Mexico — the tradition of Maria Sabina, whom many see as an ancestor of the global psychedelic movement.

So let’s explore these ancient contexts not to copy them, but to honor where we come from and the wisdom we’re inheriting.

Simon, the floor is yours.

### Opening & Context Setting

**Simon Yugler:**

Thank you, Mario.

I like to begin with a little poetry. This is a poem by Joy Harjo, the first Native American U.S. Poet Laureate. It’s called *The Story Wheel*, from her book *An American Sunrise*.

> *I leave you to your ceremony of grieving, which is also of celebration, given when an honored humble one leaves behind a trail of happiness in the dark of human tribulation...*

(Abridged for brevity here — you can insert the full poem if desired.)

This poem feels like a reflection on healing. So welcome, everyone, to tonight’s class. Let me go ahead and share my screen...

**Simon Yugler:**
I also just want to thank those of you with your cameras on — it really helps me feel connected to you. I’m excited to meet you in person soon. Tonight’s topic is Indigenous Plant Medicine Traditions.

Let me name something up front: it’s awkward for me to be giving this lecture.
The lecture itself actually arose out of a logistical issue last year — Mario was supposed to fly in to teach, but got turned away at the airport. So I stepped in. And in a way, the very act of me being the one to teach this content speaks to some of the dynamics we’ll be discussing: borders, permission, privilege.

This is a quote from Robin Wall Kimmerer, indigenous writer and scientist:

> *"It has been said that people of the modern world suffer a great sadness, a special loneliness, estrangement from the rest of creation. We have built this isolation with our fear, with our arrogance, and with our homes brightly lit against the night."*  
> — from *Braiding Sweetgrass*

**Simon Yugler:**
Where are we, right now, as we begin this conversation?

Let’s start by acknowledging land. I'm currently on Klickitat land, at the confluence of the White Salmon and Columbia Rivers, in what is now Washington State. Wherever you are, I invite you to reflect: whose land are you on?

Right before this talk, I Googled the word “medicine,” like, an hour ago.  
This image came up — an art piece Google generated to define “medicine” in 2025. Pretty interesting, right? Google and the internet have kind of become our collective psyche.  
So this is Google's answer. Pills.

Then I searched for “healing.” And this is what came up — images of hands, affirmations, chakras, meditation, a chain turning into a dove.  

One image I really liked showed a circle of people holding hands — a more communal, relational image. Just something to chew on.

And then I found this very uplifting image of a hospital room... it just looks like a place where I’m really going to feel some healing energy.
