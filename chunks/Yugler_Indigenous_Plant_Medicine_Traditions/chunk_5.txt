### Capitalism & Career Pathways

**Simon Yugler:**
Let’s talk about capitalism.  

Healing, in our current model, has to be a viable *career path*. That means it’s shaped by market forces, class structures, professionalization, and colonial histories.  
The context of healing isn’t just neutral — it’s culturally specific.

And in this model, healing is focused on the *individual* — usually framed as “mental health improvement” or *symptom reduction*, rather than *community health* or *ecological balance*.

So we’re left with this kind of sterile, often hyper-individualized framework. And I still struggle, even as a licensed mental health professional, with the term “mental health.”  

I even write in the opening pages of my book:  

> “Psychedelics are not about improving mental health.”  

That’s a deliberately inflammatory statement, but I stand by it.

### Modern Symbols of Healing

**Simon Yugler:**
What images do we use to symbolize healing in modern culture? The caduceus? That’s Hermes' staff — originally used to traverse between the upper and lower worlds. Not even a medical symbol. The real one was the staff of Asclepius — one snake, not two. But anyway.

I found some other visual representations. There’s the person whose head is filled with tech, schedules, markets, stressors — this kind of cerebral overload. Another image shows equations and lines — linear thinking, analytical obsession. Another shows a depressed figure, illustrating our mental health narrative.

All of these point to our current, fragmented cultural frame. And I think it’s worth asking:  
> Is this context truly capable of holding the depth and complexity of what psychedelics offer?

### Indigenous Responses to the Psychedelic Renaissance

**Simon Yugler:**
Now I want to shift into something I’ve been observing — the responses of Indigenous communities to the so-called “psychedelic renaissance.”

This beautiful textile on the right of the slide is from the Shipibo people of Peru. These intricate designs are visual representations of how Ayahuasca communicates with them — often received and woven by the women of the community.

First thing to name — and this is crucial:  

*Indigenous people are not a monolith.*  
There’s no one “Indigenous perspective.” Different cultures hold different traditions, values, and cosmologies.

That said, here are some recurring concerns I’ve encountered:
