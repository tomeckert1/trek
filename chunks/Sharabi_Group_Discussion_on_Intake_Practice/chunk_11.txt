### Ending reflections and next steps

**Tal Sharabi**     
So actually we have just a few minutes before we end the day.  

It’s been so lovely to walk with you through this day of *relationship*—exploring what it means to hold relational space.  

From here, we’re going to continue building on that.

Next time we meet—in the next intensive—we’re going to go deeper into nuanced attending.  
We’ll focus on ethics, and we’ll also receive a special video lecture from Jason about orientation.  

That will build on the skills you’ve been developing today.
