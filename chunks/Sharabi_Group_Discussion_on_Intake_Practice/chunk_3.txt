So that breath... can we do that together?

Let's breathe together, okay? Just take a deep breath in...  
You just went through a big experience, so let yourself breathe into the here and now.  
Notice if there's any tenderness inside you—just give it a little hug with your next breath. Great.

I asked the first row how we’re doing, but I wonder—would anyone like to share a few words?  
How are we doing right now?

**Participant** 
I had a lot of anxiety going into today, knowing we were going to practice with the intake forms.  
But after talking about it and going through it, I feel extremely relaxed and present.

**Tal Sharabi**  
What helped you feel relaxed and present after the experience?

**Participant**  
The safety that Trevor provided and his approach. It made me feel really comfortable—like I could say whatever was coming up inside without fear of judgment.

Or what we call in the industry, "unconditional positive regard."

**Participant 2**  
I second that. I was very anxious this morning, especially about the vulnerability of bringing this document. Also, role playing makes me a little anxious.  
But I felt so seen. I feel very wide open—vulnerable, but in a good way.  
Tessa did a beautiful job asking the right questions, listening. She has this gift of listening without saying anything but making me feel deeply heard. That felt really good. Delightful, even.

**Participant 3**  
I was literally openly sobbing with Katie when I was the client—and I'm not a crier!  
Whatever impression you had of me? Incorrect.  
It was just amazing and beautiful to get to go there. It felt quite psychedelic, even just doing this part of it.

I asked to be the client first because I wanted to learn from Katie.  
She has very excited energy, which for me really works. I feel invited to be who I am, accepted with unconditional regard no matter what I say—even if I think it’s “bad” or “wrong.”  

Of course, there’s no bad or wrong, but I don’t always know that.  
Fantastic. At the end, I was like: I wish we could do psilocybin now.  
I want more of this.
