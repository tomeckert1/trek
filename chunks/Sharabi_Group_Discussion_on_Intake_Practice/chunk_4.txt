### Relational Presence in Intake practice

**Tal Sharabi**   
That’s really nice.  
I’m hearing a lot of heart-opening presence, connection, welcoming, and love.  

They say in psychotherapy that it doesn’t really matter what technique or modality you use—what actually matters most is the relationship.  
So maybe you all felt some of that today.

### Facilitator emotional regulation and client presence

**Participant 4**  
At one point, I got emotional when I was the client. Sydney did a great job of holding the space.  
But it made me wonder: what if I’m the facilitator and the client is getting emotional—and that triggers something in me?  
What if I become emotional or dysregulated—how do I handle that as a facilitator?

**Tal Sharabi**  
That’s a great question. I have a few answers, but let me gather my thoughts...  
One way is to be honest.

Dan Siegel gives the example of how when you’re holding space for a child, your nervous system becomes the regulatory container.  
The same is true for our clients—they’re borrowing our nervous systems to help regulate theirs.  

If you’re having emotions and you’re still centered—still regulated—that’s okay.  

There can be honest communication around that.  

I know a therapist who tells clients: “I cry easily. You don’t have to take care of me. I might get tears in my eyes sometimes.”  
That kind of disclosure and consent can be very helpful.

**Tal Sharabi**  
Sometimes clients say something so moving that I get tears in my eyes—but I’m still holding the space. I’m still the “adult.”  

Those are therapy words—but they’re also parenting words, relational words.

I want to invite a brief reflection:  

Is there an emotion or form of expression that’s hard for you to be around?  
Hard for your nervous system to stay regulated around?

**Participant**  
When you say “expression,” do you mean like crying, or loud behavior? That kind of expression?

**Tal Sharabi**  
Yes—emotional expression, behavioral expression.  

For example, if someone gets really big, animated, or loud—that can be triggering.  
Different styles of expression can be overwhelming for different nervous systems. It’s good to know your own edges.
