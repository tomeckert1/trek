### Lying during intake and relational detection

**Participant** 
Obviously this didn’t happen today, but what do you do if you think someone is lying to you during their intake?

**Tal Sharabi**    
That’s a great question.  
It depends on the nature of the lie. But usually, when someone’s lying, you can feel a lack of connection.  
They may be trying too hard to please you, offering a lot of compliments or over-accommodating. It feels imbalanced—like there’s no channel of mutual presence.  

And that’s why we take our time. We’re not interrogating, we’re being relational.  
If we’re being relational, the truth usually emerges. People may feel safer to bring it forward.

Yes—some people hide things, like past psychiatric hospitalizations or a diagnosis. That happens.

I have a friend who *really* wanted to be accepted to a psilocybin retreat.  
He was so eager that he lied and *made up* a story about having schizophrenia in his family—thinking it would *help* him get accepted.

I had to step in as the middleman and explain that he was lying out of desperation.

People may lie because they *really* want this.  
But also, your *body* often knows. Trust your body.
 
I once did a screening call with someone in Jamaica. From the first moments of the call, my heart was pounding for no reason.  
There was something off. My body was freaking out.

That was enough for me to decide: “I don’t think we’re a fit.”  
  
You don’t have to play detective. Listen to your gut.

Same. If something feels weird, that’s an orange flag.  
Sometimes people are just anxious or people-pleasing. That’s not necessarily a red flag.  

The key is: take your time. Let the relationship deepen. Show your sincerity.  
Theirs will probably follow once they understand the nature of this work.

Until you have a green light *internally*, don’t move forward.
