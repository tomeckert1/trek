### Language use and embodied communication

**Participant*  
I probably have to resist the urge to say things like “I’m so sorry that happened to you.” Are there boundaries around that kind of expression?

*Tal Sharabi**   
I’m a somatic relational person. For me, anything disingenuous isn’t a good idea.  

When someone says “I’m so sorry that happened to you” in a default way, it can feel condescending—like you’re just observing, not present with them.

But if you’re *in it* with them—if your nervous system is attuned—the words will come from a different place. They’ll feel embodied and authentic.

**Simon Yugler**  
A lot of what we say in everyday life—“Oh I’m so sorry that happened”—can come across as hollow in this kind of container.  
If it’s not embodied, it can erode trust.

Clients may have heard those phrases a lot already. “I don’t want you to feel sorry for me.”  

And if you’ve said it genuinely and they resist it, you can explore that: “That’s something you’ve heard before. What does that feel like?”

That’s a non-directive reflection. It allows their feelings to come forward.
 
Another example: when someone tells you they’re a veteran, people often reflexively say “Thank you for your service.”

I know a lot of veterans who really don’t like hearing that.  
It can feel generic—or worse, it can make them feel unseen. Like, “Thanks? I did horrible things... I don’t want to be thanked.”

So I don’t say that anymore.

**Participant**  
But if a veteran is telling you about their service and the sacrifices they made, and you’re truly in it with them, couldn’t a “Thank you” be appropriate then?

**Simon Yugler**  
Totally. If it’s coming from an embodied place, not a knee-jerk reflex.  
And especially if it’s not about *you* feeling comfortable—it’s about being present for *them*.

**Tal Sharabi**  
Yes. It’s not about our agenda. When holding space for someone who’s different from us, we want to be especially gentle with their perspective and worldview.

### Cultural sensitivity and impact of common phrases

**Participant**  
In this room, a veteran told me they didn’t know a single veteran who liked hearing “Thank you for your service.”

I used to work in support of the Navy, and said that phrase often. A senior person once gently told me: “It’s kind of like oatmeal.”  
That feedback helped me realize we sometimes overuse language in an attempt to express care, but it backfires.  
Our intention doesn’t always match the impact.

**Tal Sharabi**  
That’s a powerful example.  
I’ll be teaching a class on transference and projections soon, but this connects to that.  

We all project, all the time. Bringing relationality to everything means we’ll also have differences—and those differences create projections.  
Saying something from *our* worldview might unintentionally impose a story onto someone else’s identity.

**Tal Sharabi**   
Thank you.
