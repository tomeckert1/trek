### Reflections on client role and facilitator boundaries

**Tal Sharabi**   
Actually, I have a leading question for you.

*How was it for you to be the client?*  
 
And did you learn anything for yourself about what’s important in *being* a facilitator—both practically and emotionally?

**Participant**  
I think you have to know what you’re comfortable with.  
Carol and I talked about the types of trauma or client experiences we’d be okay working with—and where our limits are.

Like, physically, would I work with someone who’s 300 pounds and could overpower me? Probably not, for safety reasons.

So it’s important to think about not just emotional or psychological readiness, but also physical comfort and capacity.
