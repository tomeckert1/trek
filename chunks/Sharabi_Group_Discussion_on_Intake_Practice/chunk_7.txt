### Deciding client fit and making referrals

**Participant**  
How do you tell someone “we’re not a good fit” without it being hurtful?  
Maybe it’s about directing them to someone else, but what do you actually say if you’re feeling that?

**Simon Yugler** 
Yeah, it’s hard. I don’t like disappointing people. I don’t like letting them down, so it’s extra hard.

If there’s a clinical reason—like, “We’ve been talking and it seems like you’re working with this specific kind of trauma, and I don’t have training in that”—then that’s the best case.  
You’re helping them see why they’d be better served by someone else.

The worst case is when you have to say “I don’t think we’re a fit” and they take it personally. But honestly, that’s not your responsibility.  
Your job is to make a safe decision.
 
We also have a responsibility to the *field*.  

If we think someone isn’t a good fit—not just for us, but for *this kind of work*—it’s on us to help educate them.  

Don’t just send them away. Help them understand *why*. Maybe they need longer preparation.  
Maybe they need a specialist. Maybe psilocybin isn’t the right modality for them right now.

Help them orient. That helps the whole field stay safe.

**Simon Yugler**  
Yeah. In my own practice, I had someone I worked with—six months of preparation, a psychedelic session, and integration.  

Then he was good for a while, and later came back wanting more work.

But something in me never fully trusted the fit.  

When we started again, he got really upset over something small. It felt off.  
I brought it to my colleagues and community, and they said: “Don’t do it.”

So I told him, “I’m happy to work with you in therapy, but I don’t feel comfortable doing psychedelic work with you again.”  
He didn’t like that. It was hard.

But it was the right call.

**Tal Sharabi**    
It takes courage.  
This is part of your role as a gatekeeper—not to block people, but to ensure readiness and safety.
