### Soft starts and intake pacing

**Participant**  
I worked with Megan, and one thing she did that really helped was a *soft start*.  

She probably read the room—my intake gave her a few clues, but I didn’t go into a lot of detail.

She started with a chart and asked a light question about anxiety.

That soft entry helped me open up, and she did it with such grace and love.  
It made me feel safe.

**Megan**  
Thanks. I actually saw that you had your hand up and wanted to make sure you got called on.  
But yes, I was with Joe, and I tried to go soft—but *he* went where he wanted to go.

So my plan to “go slow” met the reality of the client.

That’s a great point. Sometimes clients come in *hot*—they go straight to the depth of their experience.

If your nervous system is like, “Whoa, that’s a lot,” then it *might* be a lot for them too.

You can slow it down.

Say, “Let me pause you for a moment.” You can redirect or soften the pace.

Even just saying, “As we go through this, I’ll be guiding us through some information,” helps set that container.

I started with the chart and asked, “What’s your relationship with anxiety?”  

That’s a softer way in.

**Tal Sharabi**    
Beautiful. So you were moving around the material in a relational way—not jumping right into it.

Setting the context and pace gently.

One thing we didn’t mention: clients may think they’re supposed to just “share everything” in the first intake.

It helps to explain, “This session is a little more structured—I’ll guide us through a few things, and in future sessions we’ll go more open-ended.”

That’s a micro-contract. “Can we talk about this?” “Is it okay if I pause us for a moment?”

That builds trust and permission.
