### Group ceremony intake and facilitator ratios

**Participant**  
What’s the process for a *group* ceremony?  

Do you still do individual intakes for everyone?

**Simon Yugler**  
Yeah, that’s a whole other bag of tricks.  
As far as I know, in Oregon you’re required to do an *individual intake* with each participant, even for group sessions.

I don’t know if Colorado is different.
 
Beyond the regulations, it’s also just best practice.  

You want to really know each person individually *before* forming a group.  
Treat them each as individual clients first—then you can begin the group work.

We’ll go deeper into group work soon. There are important considerations about how to form a group, who to include or exclude, and the intake process helps with that.

**Participant**  
Is there a ratio of facilitators to participants in group work?

**Tal Sharabi**   
Yes, we’ll cover that in detail in a future session. I believe Intensive 6 is focused on group facilitation.

There’s a chart that outlines the ratios—like 1 to 25 depending on dosage and session length—but we’ll provide full context for that later.  
Hearing just the numbers can be confusing without the full picture.

Any other reflections or questions? We have about seven minutes left.
