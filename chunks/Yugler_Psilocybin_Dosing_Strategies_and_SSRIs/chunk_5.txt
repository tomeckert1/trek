### SSRIs, Receptor Dynamics, and Clinical Considerations

*SSRI Overview*
- *Most common antidepressants.* Affect serotonin (5-HT) signaling by blocking reuptake at the synapse.
- *Mechanism:* Keeps serotonin in the synapse longer → increased signaling through 5-HT1A receptors.

*Psilocybin and SSRIs*
*Risks:*
- *Psilocybin activates 5-HT2A*, associated with insight, plasticity, and transformative states.
- SSRIs *downregulate all serotonin receptors over time*, including 5-HT2A.
- This can lead to *blunted response* to psilocybin in clients on SSRIs.

*Clinical Observations*
- SSRI users often need *30–50% more psilocybin* to achieve similar effects.
- Some require *8–12 grams dried* to reach breakthrough states.
- *Boosters are essential* in SSRI clients — dose must match the individual, not the protocol.
