### Tapering Off Antidepressants

**Erica Zelfand**
- *Tapers should be slow — over months.* Cold-turkey or fast tapers often cause serious destabilization.
- *Monitor for withdrawal syndrome.* Fatigue, brain fog, emotional crashes.
- *Coordinate with prescribing doctors.* Facilitators should not advise or manage medication tapers independently.

### Serotonin Syndrome Risk

**Erica Zelfand**
- *Low risk with psilocybin.* Serotonin toxicity is rare, mostly seen with MAOIs or drug stacking.
- *Do not combine:* SSRIs + Ayahuasca or MDMA, 5-HTP supplements, or multiple serotonergic meds.

### Practice Takeaways

**Erica Zelfand**
- *Do not pill-shame.* SSRIs can be lifesaving and are valid tools.
- *Assess rapport before escalating dose.*
- *Microdosing is nuanced.* It has pros and cons — neither a cure-all nor useless.
- *The brain takes time to adapt.* Receptor sensitivity and neuroplasticity evolve over weeks to months.
