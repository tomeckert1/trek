### Dosing Strategies and Subjective Effects

Before we talk about numbers and dosing, I want to say loud and clear: *the map is not the territory*. What I’m about to present is a topographical map — it gives a lay of the land — but it doesn’t tell you if there’s fire, water, or bears on that trail.
 
*Core Principles of Dosing*
- *Expect the unexpected.* Every person and every session is different. A small dose can take someone deep; a large one can do very little.
- *Body weight ≠ dose response.* This is confirmed both clinically and experientially.
- *Dose response is more psychological than physical.* Trauma history, psychological defenses, and emotional readiness are far more relevant than size or weight.

*Other Key Factors*
- *Set and setting.* Comfort, safety, relational connection, and environmental cues all matter.
- *Facilitator relationship.* Rapport with the guide can greatly influence the experience.
- *Mushroom variability.* Even lab-tested mushrooms can vary by batch, flush, and part of the mushroom.
