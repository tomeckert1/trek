### Introduction to Scope of Practice

**Jason Foster:**
Hi. I'm here to talk about scope of practice.

Scope of practice basically describes the limits of what you can say and do as a facilitator.

There are two ways of thinking about scope of practice:
1. The *issues and conditions* you can treat or work with.
2. The *procedures and actions* you can take to address those issues and conditions.

### Client Issues and Conditions

**Jason Foster:**
This slide shows some of the issues and conditions clients might come in with.  
- The *small circle* includes issues all of you should be prepared to work with by the end of this training:
  - Depression  
  - Anxiety  
  - Stuckness  
  - Grief and loss  
  - End-of-life anxiety  
  - Spiritual seekers or “pollinators” (a nickname for people introduced to psychedelics through reading Michael Pollan’s book)  
  - Psychedelic-curious individuals  
  - The “worried well” (a therapy term for people who don’t meet diagnostic criteria but may benefit from support)

- The *big circle* includes issues that some of you may or may not be able to work with—depending on your background and training.

Everything *outside* the big circle (which we’ll get to next) is likely to be a *contraindication*—though some situations fall into gray areas.

Even if you’ve worked with a particular population before (e.g., as a therapist), that doesn’t automatically mean you’re prepared to work with them in the context of psilocybin.

For example, if you're familiar with bipolar clients, you still need to ask: Does this person fall within my facilitator scope of practice?

### Gray Areas and Expanding Scope

**Jason Foster:**
Some examples of gray areas:
- *How much trauma* moves a client outside your scope?
- *What type of trauma* are you competent to hold?
- *How far along in chemical withdrawal* does someone need to be before facilitation is safe?

Get used to asking yourself:
> “Is this outside my scope of practice?”

Especially as a new facilitator, consult often and err on the side of caution.
