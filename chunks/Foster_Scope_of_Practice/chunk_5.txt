### Procedures and Actions

**Jason Foster:**
Scope of practice isn’t just about client conditions—it’s also about what facilitators are and are not allowed to do.

*Actions Clearly Within Scope*
These are safe and appropriate within your role as a licensed facilitator:
- Orienting a client
- Administering a psilocybin session (in coordination with a licensed service center)
- Assessing client fit
- Conducting an intake
- Referring a client to a therapist or physician

*Actions Clearly Outside Scope in Oregon*
These are prohibited for all facilitators:
- Diagnosing a client
- Recommending specific health treatments
- Handing the psilocybin to the client (must be done by the service center operator)
- Engaging in any sexual activity with a client
- Claiming that psilocybin will heal or cure a disease
- Physically touching or massaging a client
- Performing Reiki on a client’s pet (or other non-consensual or inappropriate ritualistic behaviors)

You can say, *“Have you considered talking to a doctor about this?”*  
You cannot say, *“You need to do a cleanse,”* or recommend a specific treatment plan. That would be outside of your scope.

### Avoiding Promises or Medical Claims

**Jason Foster:**
Be careful what you tell clients psilocybin “can do.”  
You *cannot* promise results or offer any guarantee.

It’s okay to share personal stories:  
> “After my own psilocybin session, my chronic neck pain went away.”

But always follow it with:  
> “We don’t know what will happen for you.”  
> “There’s no guarantee you’ll have the same experience.”

Avoid setting *false expectations*.

### Psychotherapy: A Special Case

**Jason Foster:**
Doing psychotherapy is a gray zone. It may straddle the outer circle of your scope.  
You’ll learn during this training which of your therapeutic skills overlap with what’s allowed in facilitation.

Some therapist-facilitators will need to *unlearn* certain habits:
- Talk less
- Intervene less
- Lean back

This is a different role than being a therapist. Facilitation is not psychotherapy.
