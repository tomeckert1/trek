### Abiding Presence and Session Variability

**Jason Foster:**
Remember when I used the phrase *abiding presence* earlier? All the skills you bring are grounded in presence. That’s the most important thing you offer in medicine space.

Each session is going to look different. Some clients will be quiet, resting under the eye mask. Others might be cathartic and expressive. Sometimes you’ll do almost nothing. Other times, you’ll be quite involved.

But always, whether you're talking or just sitting, you bring your calm, empathetic, grounded, abiding presence.

That means:
- Being aware and attuned
- Being non-reactive and maintaining a well-regulated nervous system
- Staying curious

**Jason Foster:**
You allow the client's experience to unfold.

Think of it as walking side by side with someone through a landscape you’re both unfamiliar with. Trust that something in them knows the way. You're there to companion them, not to make something happen.

You carry the extra water and the first aid kit, but you're not trying to influence the path they take. And hopefully, because you've been on journeys of your own, you know that when a thunderstorm darkens the sky, you don't need to panic or even take shelter. You can remain calm, even if the path gets obscured or washed away.

You don’t need to pull the client out of a flash flood river of grief — you can float along with them.
