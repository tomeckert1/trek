### Quiet Check-Ins and Not Pulling Them Out

**Jason Foster:**
Sometimes, your client may look peaceful under their mask — very quiet. And you might feel an inner tension:
> “Should I interrupt and check in, or just let them be?”

At the *beginning* of the session, you're assessing:  
- Is the medicine working?  
- Are they doing okay with it?

Some people might be confused or anxious. Or stuck in *“I’m doing it wrong.”*

**Jason Foster:**
So: *check in quietly.*

Make an agreement ahead of time about how to check in:
- Should I say your name?
- Should I whisper?
- Should I stay further away?

*Don’t startle them.*  

*Don’t touch them first.*

If they were struggling last time you checked in, check in more often. If they were doing well, give them more space.

And if they’re struggling but have experience with journeying, you might just say:
> “I’m here if you need me.”

Sometimes, that’s all that’s needed.

**Jason Foster:**
If they’re *new to journeying*, you might be more direct and ask:

> “How are you doing?”

You’ve already discussed in preparation that they can simply say,  
> “I’m fine,”  
and that they don’t have to explain more unless they want to.

You don’t want your check-in to *pull them out* of their process.

During prep, you give them *options* for how to respond, and let them know they can ask you to check in less often.

Let them know:
> “I won’t be offended if you ask for more space.”
