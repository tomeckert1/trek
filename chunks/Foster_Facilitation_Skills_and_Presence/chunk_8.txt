### Language and Power in Orientation and Session

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s talk about *language and power*.

In orientation — aside from safety agreements — everything you offer should be framed as an *invitation* or a *suggestion*. Your language should reflect that.

You might say:
- “I want to invite you to put on the eye mask.”
- “Can I suggest that you take a deep breath?”

**Jason Foster:**
- “My hand is available.”

We’ll go deeper into consent around touch later, but the spirit of the language matters.

Also, prefer *“what” questions* to *“why” questions.*
“What are you feeling in your body?”  
— This brings them into the present.

“Why are you feeling that?”  
— This takes them into their head and demands justification. Avoid that.
