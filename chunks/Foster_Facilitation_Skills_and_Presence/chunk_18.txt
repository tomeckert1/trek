### Validation and the Client's Inner Experience

**Jason Foster:**
As a facilitator, you're not *validating the characterization* — you're validating the *client’s experience*.

That reflection helps the client go *deeper* into their process.

### Holding the Dark Side and Challenging Content

**Jason Foster:**
Sometimes clients will say *really challenging things*.
> I worked with another therapist whose male client, under medicine, talked at length about his penis and relationships with women — in ways that struck her as misogynistic.  
> This hadn’t emerged in their traditional therapy.

So be prepared for the *dark side* of people to emerge.

Can you hold that?
