### Audience Q&A

**Frank:**

So, the phrase *“unconditional positive regard”* gets used a lot — maybe too much.

I’ve asked some friends in adjacent fields what they think. One said, *“There’s no such thing.”* Another said, *“I have unconditional positive regard. I just love certain people at a distance.”*

Can you speak to how you hold *unconditional positive regard* in what you do?

**Jason Foster:**

Good question.

What comes to mind is the statement: *“Boundaries are the way I can love you and me simultaneously.”*

The *container* is where this amorphous unicorn called unconditional positive regard can show up. Because to live that way all the time? You’d have to be a *bodhisattva*, radiating that endlessly.

It’s like — I’m a therapist in the room, but then I go home and argue with my partner.

So for me, the *container and its boundaries* are what allow unconditional positive regard to exist.

**Jason Foster:**
I had a client once who was screaming like a two-year-old. He’d regressed, yelling *“Why won’t you love me?”* in the body of an adult man. It was painful to witness.

But drawing on that concept — unconditional positive regard — helped me *connect with his suffering*, rather than shift into judgment like *“God, you’re so entitled.”*

**Simon Yugler:**

I like the phrase *unconditional positive regard* more than *love*, because *love* can be so loaded and misinterpreted.

*Regard*, to me, is a *witnessing word*. I can regard you and your experience without judgment, and find where I might feel empathy — without needing to rescue you or make you feel a certain way.

**Participant:**

How did you deal with that specific situation — the man yelling that he wanted to be loved?

**Jason Foster:**

Well, he wasn’t yelling *at me*. He was yelling at an imagined mother.

I mostly just *allowed it*. There wasn’t much getting through to him — it felt like a *blast of infantile rage* being expressed. He wasn’t really asking for something in that moment. It was just coming through.

**Participant:**

I wanted to share something about *moving in the space mindfully*.

I was in a facilitated journey last year, and as I was easing into the experience, my facilitator unzipped a bag — it sounded like jeans unzipping — and it *immediately reminded me of a rape situation*.

So I checked in with myself — *“You’re safe. You chose to be here.”* I had tools, and I was able to move through it.

But that one, *simple sound* had a big impact. Thankfully, I got through it, but I shared it in the post-session debrief.

**Jason Foster:**

Can I ask — did it feel like a “grist for the mill” kind of thing?

**Participant:**

A what?

**Jason Foster:**

It’s a phrase Ram Dass uses — about how challenges can become *opportunities for growth*. Was this ultimately healing in any way?

**Participant:**

Not in that journey, no. Not specifically.

**Jason Foster:**

Thank you. Yes, it's a good reminder to be *mindful of seemingly small things* like zippers. We're not trying to trigger people, and *accidents can happen*, but awareness helps.

**Participant:**

When my classmate and I did our intake, we talked about lunch and bathroom breaks. The client said, *“If you go to the restroom, don’t tell me. Just leave a note.”* That way if they look up and see a note that says *“restroom”*, they know not to worry or feel interrupted.

Even something like *unwrapping a sandwich* can be disruptive. I'm really glad we talked about it beforehand.

**Jason Foster:**

Right. I think we’ll have a *whole conversation about self-care* during the journey.

If you’re going to eat, don’t eat *stinky food*. Unwrap it ahead of time. Especially power bars — those wrappers are really crinkly — so unwrap them in advance.

Just be really *mindful of the impact* those things can have.

**Simon Yugler:**

And just another point about nuance, right?

Like if my client shared with me that me opening my bag brought up *that kind of memory*, I’d be like — *holy shit*. Filing that in my memory bank. It becomes part of my awareness.

So for all of you as facilitators — it’s not about *getting it perfect*. It’s about receiving that feedback and putting it into your awareness.

**Participant:**

I had an experience in Jamaica, and I had come through the intense part of the journey. We were chilling out a bit.

I looked over and my facilitator was sitting kind of far away. I thought, *“I guess she needs a break.”* And then I started laughing, like — *a break from what? I haven’t talked to her in three hours!*

So I waved her over and asked her to hold my hand.

When she did, I just *burst into tears*.

From a *dose space*, I know what that felt like. But I’ve always wondered: *what does that look like from a facilitator’s standpoint* — sitting there for hours, and then all of a sudden, this?

**Jason Foster:**

I'd probably have a moment of like, *oh, here we are*.

Just a sweet warmth toward the client. Probably wouldn’t do much — just keep holding your hand.

**Participant:**

Nice. It was a good experience.

**Jason Foster:**

Let’s start with that one.

*Don’t look at your phone.* You might get a message or news that disturbs you — and that *will* show up in the space.

Keep your phone in *airplane mode*.

And if you're going to read something to combat boredom, avoid *violent crime thrillers*. Maybe read something *spiritual*, or *poetry*.

Also, boredom sometimes has something *underneath it* — your own material. Maybe there's something in you that’s trying to arise.

So sitting still might actually be hard *because* it brings up something you’ve been avoiding. That could point to something in you that *needs attention*.

### Closing Remarks

**Jason Foster:**

Alright — thanks everyone. That’s the end of what I had to share.

Again, I’ll send out the slides so you’ll have access to that video by Rita Bozzi — *“When Wise Interventions Are Required in Medicine Space.”*

Appreciate the engagement and the questions — it’s a lot to hold, but it’s also a lot of what makes this work so powerful.

**Simon Yugler:**

Yeah. Thanks for letting us riff.

There’s no one right way to do this — just a lot of attunement, care, and self-awareness.
