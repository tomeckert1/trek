### Emotional Comfort and Facilitator Self-Awareness

**Jason Foster:**
Ask yourself:
> “Have I done enough shadow work to understand the value of going through an underworld journey?”

Have you experienced moments in a journey where it felt incredibly difficult — but coming through it was deeply valuable?

If you’re *uncomfortable with certain emotions*, that discomfort may get communicated to your client — even nonverbally.

They may *shut down*, tune into your nervous system, and try to be the “good client.”

**Jason Foster:**
It’s not that you shouldn’t have feelings.

> Feeling horrified when a client talks about a violation is normal, appropriate, and empathetic.

But it’s a *problem if you can’t bear those feelings* in your own body.

Harvey Schwartz says:
> “You don’t have to fix it. You don’t have to soothe. You just have to meet it.”
