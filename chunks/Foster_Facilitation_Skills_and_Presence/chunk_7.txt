### When Clients Speak from Altered States

**Jason Foster:**
Sometimes you’re not going to understand what a client is saying.

They may oscillate between speaking to you with awareness and voicing something internal, without concern for whether you’re listening. At higher doses, it might feel like they’re broadcasting from another planet.

At that point, your *empathic reflection* may be less necessary.

Not that you shouldn’t pay attention — you should — but be *very mindful about interrupting* to ask for clarification. Often, five minutes later, they’ve moved on and forgotten what they said. Your *intellectual understanding* isn't always important in the moment.

You can take notes. Maybe you revisit that in integration. But in the session, *emotional attunement* is what matters.

That’s what supports their experience.

So, again: be cautious with the impulse to clarify something they’re saying. It may not be necessary or helpful in the moment.
