### The Power of Silence and Minimalism in Response

**Jason Foster:**
Slow down.

You don’t have to respond immediately or to everything. Let the client experience the spaciousness you offer.

Presence becomes resonance — when the client *feels felt*. Because they’re in a sensitive state, it doesn’t take much for that to happen.

You might feel it in your body, and offer a very light signal of empathy — maybe a quiet “mm-hmm,” or an audible exhale.

Just don’t overdo it.

One time in a practicum, someone was doing a lot of “mm-hmm”s, and the client later said it was too much — they didn’t need that much. You don’t need to constantly prove you’re listening.

It’s most appropriate to offer an empathetic response when the client touches on something really painful — and even then, it doesn’t need to be loud.

### Avoiding Over-Engagement and Therapist Reflexes

**Jason Foster:**
If you’re trained as a therapist, you might need to unlearn some habits. In therapy, a conversation might go:

> Client: I feel so bad about how I acted in that relationship.  
> Therapist: I can see how you feel guilt about your actions and it sounds like you're giving yourself a hard time.

That’s appropriate in therapy. But in medicine space, say less.  
Let the words hang in the space. Then maybe just say:

> I hear how bad you feel.

**Jason Foster:**
Very simple.

Notice if that feels like you’re not doing enough. Your impulse to help might arise. You might feel the urge to rescue.

But remember: they may be experiencing *appropriate guilt*, and by not interrupting that process, you’re allowing them to feel something that might be important.

Now, if they’re spinning out — feeling completely crushed by their guilt — that’s a different situation. Then, yes, you may need to step in more. You can talk with them if they seem stuck.
