### Joining vs. Merging

**Jason Foster:**
When there's a shared emotional experience — in administration, preparation, or integration — we want to be clear:

- Are we *joining*?  
  (Being by their side as they experience something)

- Or are we *merging*?  
  (Being pulled *into* their experience)

**Jason Foster:**
Can you keep *half your awareness in your own experience*?

Example:
> Client: “My girlfriend is such a bitch.”
>
> Merged response: “Wow, she really sounds like it.”
>
> Joined response: “It sounds like you're feeling really hurt by her.”
