### Language That Changes the Course of the Journey

**Jason Foster:**
Notice how a question can *change the direction* of the experience.

For example:

> Client: “My mother treated me so badly when I was a child.”
>
> You: “What did your mother do for a living?” or “Have you thought about telling her how you feel?”

These questions might *redirect* the process away from what was unfolding.

### Overfunctioning, Rescuing, and the Shadow of Helpfulness

**Jason Foster:**
Be mindful of:
- *Overfunctioning*
- *Rescuing*

When the client struggles, you may feel the impulse to rescue them. That’s normal — but be careful.

Helping with *titration and regulation* is okay. That’s not rescuing.

There’s a difference between:
- Suggesting:  
  > “Take a breath,”  
  which helps them regulate,
and
- Rescuing:  
  > “Of course you're a good person,” or handing them a tissue mid-process —  

  which might *cut off their emotional flow*.
