### Natural Titration and Surface-Level Engagement

**Jason Foster:**
Clients *naturally titrate* their experience of going inward — especially when it’s difficult to metabolize.

Sometimes, that looks like chatting.

They may not be aware, but the *distraction* might help them find the resources to go back in.

Your presence and *unconditional positive regard* may help them move through that titration — between social engagement and deeper emotional work.

> “When someone can dip their toe into trauma and then pull it back — that’s empowering.”

They get a *sense of safety* and can go deeper next time.

Sometimes, people are pushed into the deep end — especially on higher doses.  
Some are ready for that. Others may feel anxiety or even panic.

We’ll talk more about those challenging moments later.
