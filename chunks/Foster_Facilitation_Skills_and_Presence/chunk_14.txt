### When to Intervene: Asking “Who is This For?”

**Jason Foster:**
Get used to asking:

> “Who is this for?”

When you decide to lean in or intervene, ask yourself:
- “Am I doing this to *soothe my own anxiety*?”
- “Am I rescuing them from something difficult because I’m uncomfortable?”

Use the acronym: *W.A.I.T.*  
*Why Am I Talking?*

Notice when your questions come from *your own curiosity*, rather than for the client.
