### Inviting Attention to the Body

**Jason Foster:**
This next part is tricky, and I’ll try to explain it clearly:

*When do you direct attention to the body?*

You don’t want to overdo it. If someone is telling a story, don’t just keep asking, “What does that feel like in your body?”

They may not want to go there — and that’s important information. Maybe it’s too hard to face in that moment.

**Jason Foster:**
But let’s say someone is telling a story and you sense they’re hovering above their emotional state. Maybe they’re speaking quickly, or verbally recounting something that sounds emotional without showing any emotion.

That might be a moment to pause and say:

> “Can I invite you to take a breath?”

Just the breath might start to activate or move their feelings. If not, then maybe:

> “Can I suggest you notice what you're feeling in your body?”

So again — suggestion, not directive.

### Attunement and Nervous System Awareness

**Jason Foster:**
*Attunement* means feeling in your nervous system what’s happening in the client’s nervous system.

You’re paying attention to the signals your body receives and responding from there.

If a client is clearly in distress, lean in. Ask how they’re doing.

If it’s unclear what kind of help they need — or whether they need help at all — ask:

> “Would you like some help?”

**Jason Foster:**
And then:

> “What kind of help would be useful right now?”

This avoids offering something uninvited. It’s not that offering help is wrong, but we can minimize intrusion through *curiosity*.

Often, clients will let you know what they need.
