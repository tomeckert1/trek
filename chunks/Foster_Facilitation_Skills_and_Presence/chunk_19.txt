### Tending to Basic Comfort and Boredom

**Jason Foster:**
Another part of your job is tending to *basic comfort*:
- Bring blankets, pillows, water.
- Help them to the bathroom.
- Don’t force Kleenex, but have it available.

And… be prepared to be *bored*.

Sometimes you’re just sitting there for hours with nothing to do while they’re in another galaxy.

You might read a book — but:
- *Flip pages quietly*
- Keep *at least 10% of your attention* on the client
- Stay alert to *subtle movements or shifts*

Some facilitators would say *don’t read at all*, and instead maintain a *prayerful presence*.

I’m curious what others think.

### Moving Mindfully in the Space

**Jason Foster:**
Pay attention to *how you move and present yourself*:
- Is your posture threatening?
- Is there a scowl on your face?
- Are you stomping your feet or walking lightly?
- Tone of voice? Intensity?
- Are you speaking too much?
- Loud breathing, sniffles, finger tapping, shifting in your seat?

Clients can be *highly sensitive* to these energetic nuances.

Take care of yourself:
- Stretch occasionally
- Move when needed
- But be *mindful* of the *impact* on your client

### Simon's thoughts

**Simon Yugler:**

You made me laugh because I was thinking about a session last summer with a client who was a cancer patient. I clear my throat a lot — sinus stuff — and I’d done it like ten times during his journey.

He peeked out from under his eye mask and said:

> “You need to check that out.”

I was like, *damn*, called out!

We had enough rapport for that to be okay, but if he hadn’t said anything, I might’ve *completely disrupted* his journey. He could’ve been processing my throat clearing unconsciously the whole time.

**Simon Yugler:**
It really highlights how much *nuance* there is in facilitation. Jason gave you the 10,000-foot view, but so much only comes through *experience*, *trial and error*, and *making mistakes*.

There’s no checklist. Just learning through *being in the work*.

**Jason Foster:**

Yeah, totally. I just want to point back to this: *Allow them to have their experience.*

There are these moments where it’s like, *“I’m here with you,”* and then you just let them have the experience they’re having.
