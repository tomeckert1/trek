### Preparation Phase and Offering Options

**Jason Foster:**
In the *preparation phase*, talk about how interaction will work. Let them know what's “on the menu” — so to speak — in terms of interaction.

Let them know they can ask for space. Or that they can ask directly for what they want.

But don’t assume what they need in any given moment. It can shift moment to moment.

You might ask:

> “Would you like me to respond to what you’re saying, or give you space to keep talking?”

### “Let the Medicine Do the Work” — A Balanced View

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s talk about a phrase you may have heard:
> “Let the medicine do the work.”

Who’s heard that before?

Yeah, a lot of people.

Sometimes that’s exactly right. You get out of the way. Other times, the client really needs you to *be there in the struggle.*

So don’t let “let the medicine do the work” become dogma.

It’s context-dependent.

**Jason Foster:**
There’s a great video on this I recommend:  
*“When Wise Interventions Are Required in Medicine Space”* by Rita Bozzi (on YouTube).

I’ll share the slides so you’ll have that.

### Supporting Autonomy and Suggestibility

**Jason Foster:**
In preparation, we talk to clients about *going inward* and the value of that. We also say:

> “You don’t have to.”

There’s no wrong way to do this. If they need to talk, you’ll talk. If they want to take the eye mask off, that’s okay.

And you’ll ask in advance:

> “During the session, is it okay if I gently suggest going inward?”

That way, *you’re not taking their agency away*, especially since they’re in such a suggestible state.

They should know that *if going inward doesn’t feel right*, they don’t have to do it. They shouldn’t force themselves.

But if they’re willing to tolerate some distress, they may discover value there.
