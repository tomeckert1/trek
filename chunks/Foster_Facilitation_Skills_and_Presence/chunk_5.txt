### Lean Back or Lean In

**Jason Foster:**
One of the questions I ask myself, moment to moment, as I'm facilitating is:  

*Should I lean in, or should I lean back?*  
Am I being active or passive? Still present, but am I engaging or simply witnessing?

At times, you may want to help or suggest something. Other times, you're just there to acknowledge and witness.

### Light Touch and Communication Principles

**Jason Foster:**
When we do lean in, we use *light touch* — energetically, metaphorically, verbally, and physically.

That means:
- Use fewer words. *Way* fewer words.
- On higher doses, clients often can’t track complex ideas. This isn’t a normal therapy session.
- Reflective empathy statements should be simple.
