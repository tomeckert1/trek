### Special Considerations: Marginalized & Non-Dominant Populations

**Gina Gratza:**
*Historical & Social Context*

- *The War on Drugs* and systemic oppression have had a *disproportionate impact* on BIPOC communities and other marginalized groups.
- Psychedelic spaces may *not feel inherently safe or inclusive* to everyone.
- *Cultural humility* involves acknowledging systemic harms and holding space for lived experiences.

*Best Practices for Cultural Responsiveness*

- *Make space for exploration*: Ask participants what helps them feel safe in spiritual, physical, and emotional space.
- *Offer referrals*: If you are not the right fit, suggest a facilitator with similar lived experience or cultural background.
- *Assessment as a tool*: Use intake questions to invite disclosure of:
  - Religious trauma or spiritual adversity
  - Sensitivities to certain settings or symbols
  - Identity-specific safety needs

*Social Location Awareness*

Example shared in training:
> “I’m a cis white female, bisexual, 36 years old, raised lower-middle class, educated in white Western institutions, in a thin, able body with learning differences. My social location influences how I see the world. My work is ongoing.”

Encouragement to explore:
- How your *identities confer power* and shape perspective
- How to *widen your circle* and include more diverse voices

- Community engagement as a practice—not just study

### Inclusivity in Psychedelic Spaces

**Gina Gratza:**
- *Reciprocity & mutuality* are essential when engaging with traditions or lineages outside your own.
- *Be explicit* about why certain practices or symbols are present.
- *Adapt protocols* to meet participant needs (e.g., prayer, language use, music, ritual elements).

> “If your space doesn’t feel inclusive—or actively triggers trauma—your client may not be able to do the work.”
