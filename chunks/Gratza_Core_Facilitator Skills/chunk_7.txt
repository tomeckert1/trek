### Basic Interviewing and Active Listening Skills

**Gina Gratza:**
These foundational skills help you stay present and attuned in your conversations with clients.

*Pay Attention to What Is Being Said*

Be present. Let your affect follow the client’s emotional tone:
- Nod
- Use affirming sounds like “uh-huh” or “mm-hmm”
- Show that you are tracking

This is part of *active listening*—communicating that you’re with them.

*Mirroring*

*Mirroring* means matching the client’s energy in a respectful and attuned way.

Example:
If someone enters the room with a lot of energy—
> “I can’t believe this happened! I got cut off in traffic again!”

You don’t meet them with flatness. You meet their energy:
> “Wow, sounds like traffic was intense. Sounds like a lot came up there.”

You don’t have to mimic or match exactly—but *attune*. Let your tone, posture, and volume reflect their level of activation. This creates resonance.

*Paraphrasing*

Take a long, detailed comment and reflect it back in a shorter form:
> “So what I’m hearing is…”

> “If I understand correctly, you’re saying…”

Paraphrasing shows the client you’re tracking, and it invites clarity or correction if needed.

*Reflecting*

This is slightly different than paraphrasing. It’s not just summarizing content—it’s reflecting emotional tone or subtext:
> “It sounds like this moment was really painful for you.”
> “It seems like you felt really misunderstood there.”

This helps clients feel seen and heard at a deeper level.

*Emotional Labeling*

This is the skill of naming emotions:
> “It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated—is that right?”
> “Would you call this sadness, or is it something else?”

Labeling emotions helps clients connect with their internal experience and builds emotional literacy.

- *Resource:* *The Language of Emotions* by Karla McLaren  
  A powerful book that reframes emotions as meaningful, communicative signals.

You don’t have to get it right. Offer a label and let the client confirm or correct it. That process itself is connective.

*Validation*

Affirm their experience:
> “It makes sense that this was hard for you.”
> “That sounds incredibly challenging.”

Validation helps clients feel accepted and grounded in their experience, especially if it was dismissed in the past.

*Reassurance*

Reassure clients about their safety in the space:
> “You don’t have to do anything you’re not ready for.”
> “It’s okay to pause. We’ll go at your pace.”

Especially in prep sessions, this kind of reassurance can reduce anxiety and build trust.
