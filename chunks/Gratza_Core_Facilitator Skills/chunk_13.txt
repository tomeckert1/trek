### Emotional Process Tracking

**Gina Gratza:**
Facilitators must develop skill in:
- *Tracking participants’ emotional arcs*
- Knowing when to *intervene* or *step back*
- *Holding space* for intense emotions such as:
  - Grief
  - Anger
  - Fear
  - Shame
  - Sexual energy

This includes supporting clients through:

- Emotional expression
- Completion of emotional cycles
- Processing breakthroughs and blocks

> This includes topics around sexuality, death, anger, rage, hate, race—knowing your edges of discomfort matters.

### Healing vs. Harm in Psychedelic Experiences

**Gina Gratza:**
While psilocybin can support profound healing, it also has the potential to create harm if not held skillfully.

*Key Points:*
- *Not every experience is healing.* Sometimes the process requires intervention.
- *It’s not always “trust the process.”*
  - Facilitators may need to offer *reassurance*, *modulate their nervous system*, or *intervene*.
- Be prepared to support a participant through existential or transpersonal territory:
  - Union with the divine
  - Death and rebirth themes
  - Ego dissolution

Facilitators should be familiar with *existential language* to help normalize and integrate these themes:
- Meaning, mortality, isolation, freedom
- Spiritual emergence vs. emergency

### Body Language Awareness

**Gina Gratza:**
Facilitators must develop *somatic attunement*—the ability to notice and interpret body cues in themselves and others.

*What to Track:*
- Body posture (e.g., slouching, tensing, curling in)
- Facial expression (e.g., clenching jaw, glazed eyes)
- Eye contact (averting gaze vs. open connection)
- Physical activation (e.g., bouncing foot, gripping hands)

> “The body says a lot. If someone is hunched over and not making eye contact, that’s something to track.”

*Somatic Awareness Includes:*
- Awareness of your *own triggers* and nervous system
- Knowing when your *own body* is reacting (tight stomach, clenched jaw)
- Using your own body to assess the *resonant field* with the client

Facilitators should practice:

- *Mindful embodiment*: knowing when to lean in or sit back
- *Evenly suspended attention*: awareness of both self and client
- *Tracking impulses to intervene* and discerning when to allow silence

> Silence can be very fruitful in this work.
