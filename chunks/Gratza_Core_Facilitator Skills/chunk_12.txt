### Transference and Countertransference

**Gina Gratza:**
- *Transference*: A client redirects feelings about a significant person in their life (e.g., a parent, former partner, or abuser) onto the facilitator.
  - Examples:
    - Seeing the facilitator as a goddess, a parent, a perpetrator, etc.
    - Expecting the facilitator to behave like someone from their past.

- *Countertransference*: The facilitator’s emotional reaction to the client, often stemming from the facilitator’s own history or wounding.
  - Examples:
    - A client reminds the facilitator of a parent, sibling, or ex.
    - A client triggers unprocessed emotions, making the facilitator reactive or overly accommodating.

> “If a client looks and sounds like your dad and you haven’t talked to your dad in five years, you may have some feelings to explore.”

### Ethical Awareness

Facilitators must hold awareness of the inherent *power differential* in the relationship:
- The facilitator is being paid.
- The client is in a vulnerable, altered state.
- Even if a client feels like a friend, boundaries must remain clear.

Jason shared a guiding principle:
> “The degree to which you deny the power you hold is the degree to which you might harm the client.”

### Managing Transference & Countertransference

**Gina Gratza:**
- *Don’t ignore it.* Track the sensations and emotional cues.
- *Seek supervision or consultation* when it arises.
- *Don’t process your issues with the client.* This is your personal work, not theirs.
- *Consider whether you’re the right person* to work with a particular client.

If it feels unmanageable:
- Refer out.
- Be honest (with supervision, not necessarily the client) about your limits.
