### Trauma-Informed Care

**Gina Gratza:**

> “Trauma-informed care acknowledges the need to understand a person’s life experience in order to deliver effective support.”

*Key Principles:*
- Empowerment
- Choice
- Collaboration
- Safety
- Trustworthiness

This applies to both *organizational policies* and *individual facilitation style*.

> “Clients can tell when you’ve taken the time to understand trauma.”

### Distinguishing Trauma-Informed from Trauma Treatment

**Gina Gratza:**
It’s important to note:
- Trauma-informed care ≠ trauma therapy
- Facilitators should *not* ask clients to recount their trauma stories unless properly trained
- Doing so without adequate preparation can *harm the client*

> “There are protectors built up around trauma. Don’t dismantle them if you don’t know how to support what gets released.”

Facilitators should instead focus on:
- *Stabilization*
- *Resourcing*
- *Pacing*

This helps the client stay regulated without needing to “process” trauma during prep.

### Creating a Trauma-Informed Space

**Gina Gratza:**
Trauma-informed care also shows up in how you prepare the environment:
- Noise levels
- Lighting
- Visual cues
- Smells

Be aware that trauma often lives in the *body*, and clients may be activated by subtle cues.

> “Trauma is not what happened to you—it’s what happened inside of you.” —Gabor Maté

Avoid assumptions:
- A client’s trauma may not seem “bad” to you, but it might have deeply shaped their experience.
- Let the client define their own experience of harm.
