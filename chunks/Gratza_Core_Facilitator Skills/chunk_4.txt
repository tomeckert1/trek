### Reflective Questions for Aspiring Facilitators

**Gina Gratza:**
Please take a moment to consider these questions. I encourage you to journal about them, bring them up in your home group, or have a conversation with another student in the program:

- Why are you here?
- Why are you showing up to do this work?
- What’s moving through you to want to be a facilitator?

Important characteristics to reflect on as a facilitator include:

- *Self-awareness:*  

**Gina Gratza:**
  What is the motivation that brings you here? Are you aware of your biases? Do you understand the cultural framework and worldview you come from? Do you know your values and attitudes?

- *Emotional objectivity:*  
  This comes into play later when we talk about transference and countertransference.

- *Competency:*  
  Competency is supported through ongoing learning and self-development—consultation groups, trainings, conferences. Our learning never ends, especially with altered states of consciousness work. This work is unfolding even as we teach it, and it likely never ends.

The more you do your own work, the more informed you become about how to support other people.
