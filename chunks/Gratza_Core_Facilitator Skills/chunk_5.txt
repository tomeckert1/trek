### The Start of the Client Relationship

**Gina Gratza:**
When people walk into your office, the relationship has already begun. How they see and perceive you is being measured and felt—how you say hello, how you greet them, how you structure that first interaction.

We want to create a sense of safety and trust from the beginning so that it can support the psilocybin experience itself being as beneficial as possible. If that trust isn’t there, how can we really expect them to trust us—or the medicine?

Carl Rogers brought us the concept of *unconditional positive regard*. When I think about it, it’s just love. It means offering people compassion no matter what they have done. It means treating people as fallible human beings regardless of their actions. Even if we don’t like what they’ve done, judgment and shame always elicit defensiveness. Acceptance creates space for safety. And when people feel safe, it invites honesty and self-exploration.

This mirrors the type of grace we all wish others would hold for us—even in our most difficult times. It also allows for deeper work in altered states of consciousness. When we know that the person holding space for us welcomes the entirety of our expression and experience without judgment, we can give permission to other parts of ourselves—perhaps less attractive parts—to come forward for healing and transformation.

### Genuineness and Authenticity

**Gina Gratza:**
*Genuineness* is a crucial quality in this work. Psilocybin and altered states often pull back the veil and reveal disingenuous behaviors or intentions.

Have you ever experienced hyper-awareness while in non-ordinary states?  
Some may even feel it’s like a superpower—the ability to intuit another person’s motives or feelings.

With that in mind, *genuineness matters*.

The more you know yourself and the more comfortable you are with yourself, the more you can be authentic and genuine with your client. If you're not, they will likely pick up on it. Their “superpowers” will notice the areas where you are not being real.

### Respect and Empathy

**Gina Gratza:**
We want to express deep respect for the thoughts, feelings, wishes, and potential of our clients. Each person will bring something unique into the room. We want to value that uniqueness.

- *Empathy—not sympathy.*  
  This distinction is critical. Brené Brown says:  
  *“Empathy fuels connection. Sympathy drives disconnection.”*  
  Empathy is a skill that brings people together and helps them feel included. Sympathy, on the other hand, can create an uneven power dynamic and lead to more isolation or disconnection.

People often don't realize this. Sympathy usually comes from a good place, but it can subtly communicate judgment or hierarchy—especially when it shows up in attempts to fix, minimize, or put a silver lining on a painful experience.
