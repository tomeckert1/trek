### Clinical vs. Transpersonal Lens Discussion

**Jason Foster**
  - *Clinical lens*: Rooted in Western psychology and medicine. Useful for intake, identifying contraindications, and understanding psychological material.
  - *Transpersonal lens*: Includes spiritual, existential, and mystical experiences that may arise in altered states.
- Emphasized that both lenses are valuable and not mutually exclusive.

**Tom Eckert**:
  - *Existential language* refers to frameworks for addressing universal human concerns—death, freedom, isolation, meaning.
  - These existential questions often open the door to transpersonal exploration.
  - The clinical lens creates safety; the transpersonal lens supports mystery and emergence.

### Breakout Room Questions

**Gina Gratza:**
Participants were invited into breakout groups to discuss the following:
1. What lens do you tend to look through—clinical or transpersonal?
2. Do you experience challenges with the other lens?
3. How might those challenges show up in a client prep, administration, or integration session?

### Participant Reflections from Breakouts

**Laurent:**
- Group included a range of perspectives: one person came from a clinical background and was skeptical of the transpersonal; another had decades of ceremonial experience but found the clinical lens harder to integrate.
- Found it valuable to hear from multiple angles and see the value in holding both.

**Becky:**
- Noted that participants come with a wide variety of backgrounds—some deeply trained in therapy, some not.
- Reflected on how much time it takes to develop fluency in either lens.
- Appreciated that learning both approaches can expand one’s capacity to serve.

**Robert:**
- Emphasized the importance of flexibility.
- Urged facilitators to attune to the worldview of the participant.
- Highlighted a conversation on emotional presence: how much of the facilitator’s emotion is appropriate in the room?

**Jennifer:**
- Reflected on how her own psilocybin experience helped bridge her clinical orientation with more openness to transpersonal realms.
- Emphasized that personal experience with the medicine can be a great leveler.

**May:**
- Comes from a religious background and finds some transpersonal language difficult.
- Prefers somatic and felt-sense approaches to spirituality.
- Appreciated her group’s view that the client’s paradigm should lead.

**Ellie:**
- Wonders how to hold sacredness of the medicine while learning clinical skills.
- Concerned that clinical lens might “mute” the magic.
- Jason reassured: clinical structures create safe containers, allowing the mystery to emerge within them.

### Final Q&A and Wrap-Up

**Question:** *Can you be in or witness both hyperarousal and hypoarousal at the same time?*
- **Jason:** Typically, no. The nervous system is generally in one or the other state. However, parts work might help explain when someone feels fragmented between two experiences.
- **Gina:** Sometimes people may have multiple parts experiencing different states (e.g., one part activated, one shut down).

**Question:** *What if a client starts sharing their trauma story and you are not trained to hold it?*
- **Gina:** Ask them to offer a “headline,” not the full story. Be mindful of whether they become dysregulated. Redirect gently if needed. It’s your responsibility to maintain safety.
- **Jason:** Reinforce structure in intake. Let clients know upfront that you may interrupt if time is needed for broader assessment.

**Question:** *What if you notice countertransference during a session?*
- **Gina:** Notice it, name it internally, and compartmentalize. Bring it to supervision, therapy, or consultation. Do not work out your own issues with the client.
- **Jason:** Not all countertransference needs to be disclosed. Use it as a tool—what is your body telling you? Use it to ask questions or check in with the client somatically.
