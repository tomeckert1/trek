### Curiosity and the “Not-Knowing” Stance

**Gina Gratza:**
Be curious. Don’t presume to understand your client’s experience.
- Be aware of your own thoughts and assessments.  
- Don’t assume they’re correct—but use them as guides for exploration.

In psilocybin work, we are moving differently than in traditional clinical settings. We’re not creating treatment plans or directing journeys. Instead, we honor what participants bring, and we stay curious.

Let curiosity sound like this:
> “Tell me more.”

Even if their story sounds familiar—to your life or to another client’s—don’t assume. Ask. Let them guide the understanding.

This supports the *“not-knowing” aspect* of the work. We don’t really know our participants after just two or three prep sessions. Even when their story sounds familiar, even when we think we understand—ask them to tell you more.

### Humanity and Humility

**Gina Gratza:**
This work calls for *humility*.

Think of the myth of Icarus: he flew too close to the sun and fell. His wings were made of wax, and his father warned him. It’s a symbol of overconfidence, disobedience, recklessness, and disregarding boundaries.

This archetype reminds us: we are not above standards of care. We are not the exception. We are not the guru. We are not above ethical practice.

If there’s a part of us that wants to be “the best,” notice it—and have compassion for it.

*Shadows* are great teachers. They are fertilizer for wisdom and growth. We’ll talk more about shadow material later in the program.

### Integrity and Repair

**Gina Gratza:**
*Ruptures* will happen in your relationships with clients. It’s part of being human and being in real relationship.

When a rupture occurs—perhaps you said something that landed poorly, or you missed a cue—you have an opportunity to *repair* and *apologize*.

There’s a great podcast by Harriet Lerner and Brené Brown titled *“How to Apologize.”* It’s a two-parter and incredibly valuable.

It’s wild how few people know how to truly, authentically apologize. But it’s a crucial skill in this work. We are going to get things wrong. We are human.

### Evenly Suspended Attention

**Gina Gratza:**
This helps us stay in *present moment awareness*—attuned to both what is happening within you and what is happening between you and the participant.

It’s also an invitation to:
- Track your own *triggers*
- Notice your *edges*
- Tune in to your body’s responses (a clench, a flinch, tension, bracing)

Track the client's body too. What are they expressing nonverbally? Are they hunched forward? Not making eye contact? Are they stiff, or are they brightening? Let that inform your awareness.

Silence can be fruitful. You don’t always need to intervene. Mindfully notice your *impulses to intervene*, and ask:
> “Do I need to lean in right now, or can I sit back and allow what is?”
