### Problematic Facilitation Patterns

**Gina Gratza:**
These behaviors may be well-intended but can lead to harm:

- *Overbonding*
  - Participants are not your friends, though you can be friendly.
  - Be mindful of dual relationships—e.g., dancing at ecstatic dance with a future client.

- *People-Pleasing*
  - The urge to make their experience “the best” can lead to overextension or over-responsibility.
  - If they have a hard experience, you may wrongly feel like you failed.

- *Projection and Countertransference*
  - Be aware of unconscious dynamics that may color your perception of the client.
  - Do your own work, bring material to supervision.

- *Savior Complex*
  - You are not here to “save” anyone.
  - The healing is theirs; your role is to hold space and support.

- *Cultural Blindness and Minimization*
  - Avoid reducing complex cultural realities to simplistic views.
  - Avoid bypassing discomfort or difference.

- *Avoidance*

  - Notice if you shy away from topics like sexuality, race, or spiritual experience due to your own discomfort.
