### The Window of Tolerance

**Gina Gratza:**
The *Window of Tolerance* model, was developed by Dan Siegel and expanded through polyvagal theory.

*What is it?*

**Gina Gratza:**
The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone of arousal in which a person can function effectively and remain emotionally regulated.

*Zones:*
- *Optimal Arousal Zone (Center):*
  - Grounded
  - Present
  - Aware of surroundings
  - Emotionally regulated

- *Hyperarousal (Above the window):*
  - Anxiety
  - Panic
  - Emotional flooding
  - Rage
  - Physiological activation (e.g., rapid heartbeat)

- *Hypoarousal (Below the window):*
  - Dissociation
  - Numbness
  - Disconnection
  - Emotional shutdown
  - Loss of time or memory

> We all dissociate to some degree—like zoning out while driving—but extreme dissociation is a red flag.

### Why This Matters for Psilocybin Work

**Gina Gratza:**
- Clients need to remain within their window of tolerance to safely navigate the session.
- Psilocybin can push people outside their window if they’re not adequately resourced.
- Facilitators must:
  - Track their own arousal state
  - Track the client's nervous system cues
  - Know when to intervene gently

### Questions to Ask Clients in Prep

**Gina Gratza:**
- “What helps you come back when you feel overwhelmed?”
- “What are your support tools?”
- “How do you know when you’ve checked out, and what helps you return?”

If a client doesn’t have answers to these questions, they may need more support before beginning psilocybin work.

> “If a client doesn’t have skills to resource their nervous system, guide them to resources before journey work.”

### Practical Implications

**Gina Gratza:**
- Watch for signs of dysregulation in intake and prep sessions.
- Develop a *shared vocabulary* around states of regulation.
- Consider pausing the process or referring out if a client cannot remain within their window even with support.
