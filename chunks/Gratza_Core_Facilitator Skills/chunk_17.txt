### Facilitator Self-Care

**Gina Gratza:**
> “We are mirror reflections for our clients.”

- If you are dysregulated, you are modeling dysregulation—even if unconsciously.
- Self-care is *not optional*; it is *a professional responsibility*.

*Practices to Sustain Your Work*

- Develop a *meditation*, *breathwork*, or *yoga* practice.
- Connect with *nature*, *loved ones*, and *supportive community*.
- Engage in *regular supervision*, *therapy*, or *peer consultation*.
- Know your limits:
  - One psilocybin session per week may be too much for some.
  - Honor what your system can hold.

> “There’s only so much we can take on before it starts to seep out and break us down.”
