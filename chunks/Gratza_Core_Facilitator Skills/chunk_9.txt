### Developing a Relationship with Your Body

**Gina Gratza:**
*Somatic awareness* is crucial for facilitators.

Learn to:
- Recognize your own nervous system cues
- Track physiological responses (e.g., tightening, heart rate, temperature changes)
- Use grounding techniques in-session

If a client is screaming for two hours, how will you self-soothe?

> Practice tools like breathwork, grounding, self-touch, and co-regulation with your co-facilitator if applicable.

Somatic awareness allows you to respond rather than react.

### Responding vs. Reacting

**Gina Gratza:**
If you don’t tend to your nervous system, you’re more likely to:
- React from fear or discomfort
- Attempt to control the session
- Disassociate or go numb

Instead, pause and *regulate*.

> “Stop. Drop. Regulate.”
> - Stop what you’re doing  
> - Drop into your body  
> - Regulate your nervous system

Then return to presence and support.

### Interpersonal Boundaries and Scope of Practice

**Gina Gratza:**
Your body will often tell you when you’re at your edge:
- A sudden pullback
- Tightening in your gut
- A sense of dread or overwhelm

These signals help you recognize:
- When something is beyond your training or scope
- When to consult or refer out
- When a boundary needs to be reinforced

Respect your limits. Doing so honors your client’s safety and your own wellbeing.

### Embodiment as Integration

**Gina Gratza:**
Being embodied isn’t just a skill—it’s a *practice and an integration tool*.

Embodiment helps you:
- Know your thresholds and capacity
- Access your intuition
- Recognize subtle interpersonal dynamics

Facilitators who are out of touch with their bodies may miss important cues—both their own and their clients’.

The more you practice embodiment, the more effective and attuned you become.

### Somatic Grounding Exercise

**Gina Gratza:**
*Instructions:*
1. Sit or stand. Find stillness and take a breath.
2. Notice where your breath is going. Is it in your chest or belly?
   - Chest breathing may indicate activation.
   - Belly breathing can promote calm.
3. Bring attention to your spine, beginning with the sacrum.
   - Lengthen your spine gently, without force.
   - Allow your shoulders to settle slightly back.
   - Let your chin be parallel to the floor.
4. Open your eyes and look to the left, then back to center.
   - Notice your peripheral vision and spatial awareness.
5. Collapse your spine again briefly.
   - Observe how your body and vision shift.
6. Return to an upright, aligned posture.
   - Note the somatic and perceptual differences.

*Purpose:*
- Reinforce the connection between posture, awareness, and perception.
- Deepen awareness of how physical embodiment affects emotional and cognitive states.
