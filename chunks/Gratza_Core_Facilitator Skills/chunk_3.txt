### Opening Grounding and Reading

**Gina Gratza:**
Hi, everyone. It's nice to see you again—and to the virtual students that I didn't see at the first intensive, it's nice to virtually meet you, see you.

I'm going to start tonight with a reading from *Inward* by Yung Pueblo. So just take a moment to ground, find your breath, and I'm going to read a passage from the book.

> There is not a single moment when change is not present.  
> The constant of the universe, the motion of impermanence, is observably evident in the world around us and the world within us.  
> If we examine nature, it is clear that everything is in a constant state of dynamic change.  
> Trees are a great example.  
> In cycles, they alternate from experiences of growth to experiences of releasing—all the while alive, all the while growing.  
> If we are refusing to grow, then we are moving against the flow of nature.  
> The flow of change is so powerful that resisting it can only cause difficulty.  
> Sometimes growth hurts, but it is the type of pain that is easier to endure, because it is helping us come forward as a better version of ourselves.

Okay.

### Introduction to Core Facilitation Skills

So tonight we are going to talk about some basic core facilitation skills. This may feel familiar to some of you who are clinically trained, but perhaps it's a nice refresher. And for some of you, this might be new. It’s okay if you don’t get it on the first hearing—we’re going to repeat a lot of these things throughout the program. This is just giving us the broad strokes in the beginning.

I’m going to be talking in the language of a clinician, because that’s how I was trained. I’m doing my best to unlearn some of that, but I might use the word "client"—just know that’s interchangeable with "participant."

We’re going to be speaking about the many ways in which you can build relationship with your participants. This is a short overview of various modes of connection, and there are more than what I’ll speak to tonight. But remember: many ways of knowing, many ways of connecting—and these are just a few.

This is just an overview. We'll go into more depth on these subjects as the program continues over the next several months, but I wanted to give us all an introduction tonight.
