### Let Participants Find Their Own Meaning

**Gina Gratza:**
Let them *come to insights on their own*.

Even if you see a powerful connection, don’t push it. Let them get there at their own pace. This is part of a *non-directive approach*.

> “That’s interesting—what does that mean to you?”
> “What do you make of that?”

If you impose meaning too early, you risk disrupting their inner process. Their insights will land more deeply if they discover them themselves.

### Trust the Process

**Gina Gratza:**
Resist the urge to interpret or explain.  
Even if a client shares a dream or metaphor that seems obvious to you—ask them:
> “What does that image mean to you?”

They may say something completely different than what you imagined. Let their interpretation lead.

### Power Dynamics and Ethical Boundaries

**Gina Gratza:**
Even in non-clinical settings, a *power differential* exists between facilitator and client. You are being paid. You’re guiding an experience. That creates an inherent imbalance.

> “The degree to which you deny the power you hold is the degree to which you might harm the client.” – Jason

Be aware of this dynamic, especially when:
- Clients express admiration or dependency
- A bond begins to feel like friendship
- You're tempted to "rescue" or be their hero

Maintain clear boundaries and ethical distance, even as you offer warmth and care.

### Tracking the Client’s Emotional Process

**Gina Gratza:**
A core skill is *tracking* what’s happening within the client and in the space between you. This includes:
- Emotional cycles
- Somatic expressions (e.g., posture, fidgeting, eye contact)
- Shifts in energy or engagement

Ask yourself:
- What’s happening in the client right now?
- Is something unresolved surfacing?
- Are they moving toward closure or becoming more activated?

This awareness helps you support integration, not just catharsis.
