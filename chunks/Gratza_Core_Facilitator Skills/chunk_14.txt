### Cross-Cultural Competency in Facilitation

**Gina Gratza:**

Creating a container of safety requires *cultural awareness*. This means actively attending to cultural, racial, ethnic, gender, and spiritual dynamics in the facilitation space.

*Key Terms:*
- *Cultural sensitivity*: Awareness of cultural differences without assumptions or stereotypes.
- *Cultural humility*: A lifelong commitment to self-evaluation, redressing power imbalances, and building respectful relationships.

> “You are engaging with your clients in assessment—asking, making space to be curious.”

*What Culture Encompasses:*
- Race, ethnicity, gender identity
- Religious/spiritual background
- Socioeconomic class
- Disability status
- LGBTQIA+ identities
- Community values, communication styles, worldview

### Practice of Cultural Awareness

**Gina Gratza:**
*Avoid assumptions*: Ask open-ended questions, explore how the client identifies culturally.
- *Name your bias*: Recognize implicit bias and seek consultation when needed.
- *Know your social location*: Understand how your race, class, gender, and other identities impact relational dynamics.

*Example: Sharing Social Location*

> “I’m a cis white bisexual woman in a thin, able body, educated in colonial institutions. My social location grants me power in ways others may not experience. My work is ongoing.”

### Working Across Cultures

- Be clear when incorporating elements from *wisdom traditions* (e.g., smudging, altars).
  - Acknowledge the *origin* and *purpose*.
  - Avoid appropriating without relationship or reciprocity.
  - Explore your own ancestral traditions and herbal allies (e.g., juniper, rosemary).

> “We’re not just building relationship with psilocybin. There are many plants worthy of relationship.”

- *Assess for cultural adversity*: Are there symbols or practices that might be activating or unwelcome?
- *Adjust accordingly*: Make changes to the physical space or ceremony elements if needed.
