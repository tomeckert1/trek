### Client-Centered Transparency and Choice

**Participant:**
Would it help to create a *“menu”* of options — like letting clients choose a tapestry or object that speaks to them?

**Simon Yugler:**
Maybe. But we need to be cautious.

> “Tarot decks, oracle cards, or even ‘spiritual’ decor could be *deeply meaningful* to some — and *triggering* to others.”  

That’s why *offering art supplies* (which are neutral and expressive) is one thing. But *offering spiritual tools* without context or consent is something else.

**Jason Foster:**
The key idea is:  
 *Don’t surprise the client*.  
 *Front-load what’s in your space* — show it on your website or during prep sessions.

That way, if you do have feathers, or sage, or a Buddha statue in the corner, your client gets to *opt in* — or *opt out* — ahead of time.

### Summary and Final Reflections

**Simon Yugler:**
To sum up:

- *Set and setting* applies as much to the *facilitator* as to the *client*.
- It's not about judgment, but about *awareness* of what we bring — our *presence*, our *rituals*, and our *cultural overlays*.
- *Ritual* doesn’t have to be ornate. It just needs *intention* and *presence*.
- *Overt cultural symbolism* can create unintended dissonance or discomfort. What feels healing to you may feel cultish or alienating to someone else.
- *Don’t impose* your idea of healing. Know your client. Respect their background and worldview.

**Jason Foster:**
> "Even the InnerTrek service center is a little bit... rave-informed. You’ve seen it, right? Just a touch of that MDMA aesthetic — velvet, colorful lighting. We all bring something."

The message is clear: The *space you create* is made of more than furniture and playlists. It’s shaped by your energy, your intention, and your *awareness* of what healing really looks like — not just for you, but for the person you're serving.
