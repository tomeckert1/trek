### Cultural Aesthetic Overload: What Does “New Age Cliché” Mean?

**Participant:**
What does “new age cliché” look like?

**Simon Yugler:**
Honestly? It often means a space filled with:

- *Trinkets*  
- *Tapestries* (often Shipibo-style or vaguely indigenous patterns)  
- *Statues* (like Ganesh or Buddha)  
- *Crystals and orbs*

It’s that *mishmash of spiritual iconography* — often pulled from different cultures without deep understanding — that gives off the impression of being spiritually “informed,” but may lack depth or cultural sensitivity.

> “You walk in and it’s just like... where do I orient myself?”  

These kinds of environments can feel confusing or even *overwhelming* for clients who come from different backgrounds or who have trauma related to religious or spiritual manipulation.
