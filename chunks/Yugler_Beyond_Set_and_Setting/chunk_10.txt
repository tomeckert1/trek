### Spiritual Syncretism and Client Expectations

**Participant:**
It’s not uncommon to hear someone say, “I’m not religious, but I’m spiritual.” And often that means they’re drawing from a kind of *spiritual buffet* — a little Native American, a little Buddhist, some Jesus and Muhammad, too.

**Simon Yugler:**
Right. And for us as facilitators, that’s *totally okay*. Again, it’s not about saying one approach is better — it’s about knowing *who your client is*.

> If your client *wants* sage, feathers, tarot — great. But if not, *respect that*.  
> The same client might find a *blank room* unsettling.  

So the principle is: *don’t impose*, and *don’t surprise*.

**Jason Foster:**
And just to highlight: clients with spiritual or religious trauma — especially *cult survivors* — might be especially sensitive. Even something small like a Buddha statue might cause them to *freeze up*.

So even if you *do* have something visible in your space, *check in*:

> “Hey, how is it for you to be in this room with me… and with that statue over there?”  
> “Would it help if I removed anything for your comfort?”

### What About Shared or Rental Spaces?

**Participant:**
Given that many facilitators use *shared or rental spaces*, what can we do?

**Simon Yugler:**
Great question. If you can’t control everything about the space, then:

- *Bring what you need* and remove what’s not needed.
- Choose items that are *neutral and natural*, like plants or mushroom imagery.
- *Avoid trinkets and spiritual mashups* when possible.

At InnerTrek’s service center, for instance, the design uses *plants, trees, and fungi* as decor — nature-based elements that are more universally grounding and less likely to trigger.
