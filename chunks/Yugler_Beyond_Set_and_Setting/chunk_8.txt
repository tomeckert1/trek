### Ritual Can Be Simple: Avoiding Assumptions and Surprises

**Tamara:**
This morning, Simon and I demonstrated a *ritual* that didn’t include any specific cultural elements — just presence, intention, and a pause to hold the medicine. That alone can be ritual.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yeah. I think sometimes we imagine that a ritual must have feathers, sage, or something “exotic” to count. But even a *simple intentional pause* can be a ritual. That’s really what I want to emphasize.

**Participant:**
At the service center I went to, they had handmade ceramic cups. You’d choose one to mix your medicine in, and then keep it. That became part of my *daily ritual* — I still use the cup. That ritual stayed with me.

**Simon Yugler:**
That’s beautiful.

### Ganesh and the Blank Slate

**Participant:**
This morning, Ganesh the water bottle showed up. What happens if something like that is in the space — but not brought by the client?

**Simon Yugler:**
We’re getting there!

Let’s open up a deeper question:  
> *Is there ever such a thing as a “blank slate” in facilitation?*

**Participants (various):**
Not really. Not with humans. Maybe it’s an ideal, or something we can approximate.

**Trevor:**
It’s like a *limit* you can get closer to, but never fully reach.

**Megan:**
Isn’t being a blank slate kind of like being curious and open?

**Simon Yugler:**
Even that’s a *culturally-informed* idea — that presence and openness are the ideal. That comes from relational psychology. So even striving for a blank slate comes from somewhere.

**Participant:**
Even in the womb, we’re already absorbing sound and sensations. We come into the world carrying *ancestral and familial lenses*. We can’t truly be neutral.

**Robin:**
And clients are going to *project onto us* anyway.

**Participant:**
Maybe the blank slate isn’t a person — it’s the *space between* client and facilitator. That connection is what you create together, and it’s different every time.

**Robin:**
Yes — and rapport matters. You don’t want to be a blank slate with no relationship. That can feel cold or clinical. Building connection is part of holding space.

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly. Don’t be the classic psychoanalyst hiding behind a clipboard. Be human.
