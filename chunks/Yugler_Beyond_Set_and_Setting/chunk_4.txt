### Facilitator Mindset: Self-Preparation

**Simon Yugler:**  
When we do this work — when we open space for others — we have to make sure that *our own mindset* is aligned. That means checking in with a few key aspects:

- *Psychological grounding*: What’s on your mind? Relationship issues? The news getting to you? You need to sort that out and set it aside before entering the space.  
- *Emotional grounding*: Are you actually emotionally available and open right now? I've had a few situations where I realized I was showing up, but emotionally not present.  
- *Energetic grounding*: Are your vibes right? I can’t exactly define this — it’s subjective — but you know when it’s off.

Facilitator self-care and how you live your life matters. It’s not just about preparing for a single session — it's about the deeper groundwork required to *be* in this role.

> Your energy is the biggest part of the space.

This is subtle but essential. More is going on than just two people in a room. There’s a complex *intersubjective space* — and, I’d argue, involvement from the *more-than-human world*.

### Beyond the Human: Intersubjective & Energetic Fields

I think it was Ram Dass — or someone I’ll pretend was Ram Dass — who said a relationship isn’t just two people. It includes:

- You  
- Them  
- Your projection of them  
- Their projection of you  
- Your idea of yourself  
- Their idea of themselves  

That’s six psychological dynamics right there.

Now add in subtle energies — maybe the space just doesn’t feel right. Maybe there are unseen forces or vibes in the room. This isn’t to be spooky — it’s to recognize that *set and setting* goes deeper than the human layer.

### The Real Work of Holding Space

**Simon Yugler:**
Creating intentional space is an *art* — and it has everything to do with the *presence* of the facilitator, and almost nothing to do with the *bells and whistles* that adorn the space.

We live in a material culture. Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the Tibetan teacher, called it *spiritual materialism* — the idea that material objects convey spiritual value.

It’s a kind of *virtue signaling*: “I have this feather. It's a spiritual feather.”

We’ll get into that. But the core point is:

> It's not about the tools.  

> It's about who *you* are as a human being — and the energy you bring into the space.
