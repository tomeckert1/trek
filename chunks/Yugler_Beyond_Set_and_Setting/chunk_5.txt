### Orientation and Intention

**Simon Yugler:** 
Set and setting is an *act of orientation*. So I want to ask:

> What are we trying to orient toward in psychedelic healing and facilitation?

**Participants (shouting out):**
Healing.  
Trusting the medicine.  
Nature.  
Flow state.  
Trust.  
Growth.  
Connection.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes — all good things.

What about *safety*?  
What about *protection*?  
What about *boundaries*?

These may not sound as fun, but you can't have safety without boundaries.

Take a look at this *mandala* — a beautiful image of sacred containment. Mandalas symbolize safety and protection. They embody boundaries.

### Psychedelics as a Quest for the Sacred

**Simon Yugler:**
  Here’s something to consider:

> When people seek out psychedelic ceremonies, what they are *really* seeking is a reconnection to the *eternal*, to the *sacred*, and to the *parts of themselves that are connected to it*.

In our spiritually starved culture, people are chasing the sacred in many forms:
- The next ayahuasca ceremony  
- The cacao circle  
- Skydiving  
- A new tattoo  

But ultimately, they are seeking connection with something *ancient and sacred*.
