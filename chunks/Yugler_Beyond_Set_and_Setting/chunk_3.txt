### Introduction: Beyond Set and Setting

**Simon Yugler:**
Thanks, y’all. Thanks, Jason.

So I want to talk for a little bit about this idea of *set and setting*. I call this lecture *Beyond Set and Setting* because I feel like the concept, as it's traditionally presented, doesn't actually go far enough.

This is based largely on the second chapter of my book. It’s about what we really mean when we talk about *holding space*. What is the space that we're holding? And it’s also about *ritual* and *cultural overlays* — the things we might be unconsciously bringing into the space as facilitators.

So we're going to get into all of that.

### What Is Set and Setting?
  
**Simon Yugler:**
Who’s heard of the idea of *set and setting* before? (Raise your hand.)

Looks like most people. Great.

Quick shout-out — who feels like they can sum it up in a sentence?

**Joe:**
It’s your mindset and the setting that you're in.

**Simon Yugler:**
Word. Okay. Cool.

Set and setting is a foundational concept in psychedelic therapy. The term was coined by Ralph Metzner and popularized by Timothy Leary.

- *Set* refers to the inner mindset: your psychological and emotional state at the time of the session.  
- *Setting* refers to the external environment: the physical surroundings, people, location — even the lighting and atmosphere of the room.

Importantly, *set and setting* apply just as much to the facilitator as they do to the client.
