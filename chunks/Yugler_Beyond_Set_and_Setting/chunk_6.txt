### What Is Ritual?

**Simon Yugler:**  
Let’s talk about *ritual*. What comes to mind when I say the word?

**Participants:**
Routine.  
Practice.  
Connection to spirit.  
Intention.  
Making your bed.  
Meditation.

**Simon Yugler:**
Love it. All great answers.

Let me quote *Mircea Eliade*, a scholar of comparative religion (sort of like a “Joseph Campbell for big kids”). In his book *The Sacred and the Profane*, he writes:

> “The completely profane world — a wholly desacralized cosmos — is a recent discovery in the history of the human spirit.”

Even atheists still exhibit behavior that approximates religious ritual. It's part of being human. Drug use itself is often *highly ritualistic*.

> “Every addict is a deeply spiritual person looking for connection in the wrong places.”

**Simon Yugler:**

### Modern Ritual and Devotion

Yes — in our society, ritual can look like *work*: getting in your 40 hours a week. One of my myth teachers used to ask:

> “At whose temple do you serve?”

Sometimes the answer is the *temple of commerce* or *the temple of money*.

Even people who say, “I don’t want anything spiritual,” still operate from what Carl Jung called:

> “The religious dimension of the psyche.”

Our psyches *cannot help* but bring symbolic, sacred meaning into the world — even if unconsciously.

**Jay (participant):**
We talk about *American civil religion* — where national identity becomes the new religion. We have our “religious holidays”: Presidents’ Day, Thanksgiving, Easter, Christmas. God has a special purpose for America. It gives people a symbolic order and moral mission.

**Simon Yugler:**
Totally. It shows up in *everything* — even politics.

### The Function of Ritual

**Simon Yugler:**
Let’s define ritual clearly.

> *Ritual is an intentional action that signals a break from the profane into the sacred.*

It has three stages:
1. Opening  
2. Middle  
3. Closing

And this mirrors *holding space*: there should be a clear beginning, middle, and end.

If any part is missing, something can feel *off*.

The key takeaway:

> *Ritual signals to the psyche that we are entering a rarefied, sacred space — a time out of time.*

It also provides *containment* and *boundaries* for intense psychospiritual processes.

And importantly:  
> *Less is more.* You don’t need fancy tools — just your *presence and full attention*.
