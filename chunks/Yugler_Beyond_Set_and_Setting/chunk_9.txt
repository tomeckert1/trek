### Meeting Clients Where They Are

**Simon Yugler:**
I love Robin’s point. The real goal here is to *meet the needs of our clients*, not to impose our own idea of healing or sacredness.

Because what *we* think is healing…

…our clients might see as something totally different.

This is Doug Henning, a Canadian magician turned politician. And this slide is kind of a joke, but also not. The point is:

> *What’s healing for you might be weird, confusing, or even off-putting to your client.*

**Jason Foster:**
I had a colleague once bring a client to a new journey space that neither of them had been to before. It turned out to be a *“new age cliché”* — filled with trinkets and spiritual decor. The client didn’t say anything, but *lost trust* in the facilitator during the session because of how the space felt.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes — and that’s exactly the kind of *unexamined cultural overlay* we’re talking about. It’s so common in psychedelic spaces to just assume certain items — Buddha statues, Shipibo tapestries, crystals — are okay. But they may not be.

### The Problem with Surprise Spirituality

**Jason Foster:**
So what do we do? One rule: *don’t surprise your clients*.

If you do have a Buddha statue, make sure they’ve already seen it during prep. Don’t let them walk into a session and suddenly be surrounded by unfamiliar spiritual items.

> Better to *include it subtly* or *disclose it early*, or not at all.

Also consider: what’s on your website? What does it communicate about your approach? Are you signaling your values in ways that might help or hinder rapport?

**Simon Yugler:**
There’s also room for *claiming a spiritual identity*:

That’s great — just don’t assume it’s for everyone. Don’t *impose* it. Let your clients *opt into* your framework, rather than being ambushed by it.
