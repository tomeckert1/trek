### Cultural Overlays: What Are We Bringing In?

**Simon Yugler:** 
Let’s talk about *cultural overlays*.

> What cultural overlays might you be bringing into your facilitation work?

By “cultural overlays,” I mean the *unconscious lenses* or *biases* that we may bring into the space — the "water we swim in" that we don't always see.

**Participant:**
Family upbringing — for example, growing up believing that *effort and achievement* are everything.

**Simon Yugler:**
And how would that show up?

**Participant:**
I'd have to be careful not to push that kind of striving energy onto the client. Like, there’s no “A” in healing.

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly — you can’t “win” at healing.

**Participant:**
As a woman raised in a patriarchal society, I feel called to work with women to help them step into their power. That’s influenced by my own experience and overlays.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes, and what are the *shadows* of those overlays if they're unexamined?

**Participant:**
Growing up Catholic, I may assume that a “unified” spiritual experience — like merging with a singular God — is the most valid. That might limit how I hold space for other kinds of experiences.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes — and even broader than that, we are shaped by the *monotheistic* culture around us. It’s easy to unconsciously favor certain types of “sacred” experiences and dismiss others.

**Participant:**
I think of cultural overlays like the 1960s psychedelic era — Ken Kesey, the Merry Pranksters, Timothy Leary. That *playful*, exploratory spirit is still an influence. But that kind of play may not always be seen as appropriate in modern clinical settings.

**Simon Yugler:**
Totally. The legacy of psychedelic *play* can conflict with the therapeutic *healing* model. If we’re not aware, we may unconsciously exclude play or look down on clients who want to dance or express joy.

**Participant:**
Also — capitalism. Even if we don’t want it to be this way, there’s always a subtle *client-provider dynamic*. Money is being exchanged.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes — and related to that is *power*. We live in a *hierarchical society*, and the power dynamics between facilitator and client can unconsciously mimic societal hierarchies.

### Recognizing Your Lenses

**Simon Yugler:**
So the point here is to bring *awareness* to what you’re bringing into the space — not to judge it.

Some examples of opposing lenses:

- *Blank slate* vs. *Culturally informed*  
- *Clinical* vs. *Spiritual*  
- *Western* vs. *Shamanic*  
- *Pharmacological* vs. *Animistic*  
- *Somatic* vs. *Conceptual*  
- *Personal* vs. *Collective*

Each of these reflects a way of seeing. None is better or worse. But *each* may be present in how you hold space.

**Participant (Frank):**
Why did you choose “shamanic” as the opposite of “Western”?

**Simon Yugler:**
Good question. Maybe not the best framing — I was trying to reflect a common tension in the field: clinical psychotherapeutic vs. traditional ritualistic. But yeah, it’s a bit muddled.

**Participant:**
I worked at retreat centers and saw harm in some so-called “shamanic” settings — no screening, dangerous clients, unsafe spaces. That gave me a bias toward emphasizing clinical and scientific structure for safety.

**Simon Yugler:**
That makes sense. This is why it’s helpful to recognize where those experiences are shaping our instincts or reactions.

**Participant:**
So you're not saying we should aim for a particular approach?

**Simon Yugler:**
No — this isn’t about prescribing a way of doing things. It’s just about *noticing* what assumptions or cultural baggage we may be bringing into the space — and checking whether it serves our clients.
