### Practical Nuggets for Preparation Work

**Simon Yugler:**
Before we shift into Tal’s deeper skills training, I want to leave you with some core *takeaways*:

*1. Listen with the Third Ear*
- Hear *what’s behind the words*.
- Deepen your intuition and sensitivity to unspoken meaning.

*2. Take Your Time*
- Spaciousness is essential.
- In my practice, preparation takes *months* — but even within a short session, slow down.
- Rushing leads to *disaster*.

*3. Cultivate Presence*
- Your *presence* is the true medicine.
- Fancy interventions aren’t necessary if you are fully *present* and *attuned*.

> *Be like a lamppost.*  
> Radiate steady light, even in darkness.  
> Your job isn't to fix — it's to *illuminate*.

*4. Handle the Story with Reverence*
- Treat the personal stories shared with you as *sacred*.
- Deep emotional landscapes may emerge quickly; be ready to meet them with care.

*5. Container Holding Begins Now*
- You start *building the container* the moment you connect with a client.
- Trust, safety, and relational depth begin *long before* the medicine session.
