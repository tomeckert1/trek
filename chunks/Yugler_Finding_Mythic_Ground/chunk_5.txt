### Myth and Personal Story

**Simon Yugler:**
Who here knows Joseph Campbell?  

*(Students raise hands.)*

Joseph Campbell, the famous mythologist, wrote:

> *"Myths are public dreams, and dreams are private myths."*

I love this quote because it connects big, abstract mythological ideas to *personal experience* — including our *dream life* and our *inner world*.

Campbell points out that there’s a deep link between *outer big stories* and *inner small stories*.  
This is a core concept I’m exploring with you today.

### A Personal Story: Encountering the Pepeha

**Simon Yugler:**
Let me tell a quick story from my own life — from my personal myth:

In 2016, I was in New Zealand leading a group of study-abroad students.  
We spent time with Māori communities — the indigenous people of Aotearoa (New Zealand).

In Māori culture, there's a tradition called the *pepeha* — a formal introduction.

When someone introduces themselves, they orient by naming:
- Their mountain
- Their river system
- Their ocean
- Their forest

They’re *placing themselves* in the mythic landscape of their ancestry and land.  
By sharing this, they offer others a way to *know their story* — because if you know someone's landscape, you know something essential about them.

### Applying This to Preparation Work

**Simon Yugler:**
We, in contrast, don't often know the mountains and rivers people come from — unless we take the time to *truly hear their stories*.

That’s what *intake* and *preparation* are about:
- *Understanding where someone is coming from* — not just factually, but *mythically*.
- *Orienting ourselves* to the deeper layers of who they are.

My hope is to *instill the spirit of preparation and intake* today — not just the techniques, but the spirit behind them.

We’ll move into the nitty-gritty later. For now, we're setting the mythic foundation.

*The Meaning of Orientation*

I’m a huge etymology nerd, so let’s dig into the word *orientation* for a moment.
- *Orientation* comes from *orient*, meaning the east — the direction of the rising sun.
- It connects to *origin* — meaning ancestry, beginnings, and the source.
- If you trace it even farther back, it links to *heritage*.

In preparation and intake, *we are literally learning the mythic origin stories of our clients*.  
That's how I like to think of it: we are receiving their *creation story*.

There's a lot there — and it goes much deeper than just the external facts of their life.
