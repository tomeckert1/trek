### Group Questions

**Frank:**
> How do you decide what part of yourself is appropriate to share with a client?

**Simon Yugler:**
Great question.  
In psychotherapy, this is called *self-disclosure*.
- Only share if it *serves the client*.
- If sharing a personal experience increases *safety*, *trust*, or *relationality*, it may be appropriate.
- It's not about telling your story — it's about *supporting* theirs.

**Frank:**
> How much of what you’re internally assessing do you actually share with the client?

**Simon Yugler:**
Minimal.
- We don’t say, “I'm assessing your ego stability” out loud.
- We observe *quietly*, without priming, labeling, or interfering.
- The intake is about letting them *show up naturally*, not shaping or diagnosing them.

### Clients Asking About Facilitator's Experience

**Student Question:**
> How common is it for clients to ask about your own psychedelic experiences?

**Simon Yugler:**
Very common.

*Important:*
- If you have *not* done personal psychedelic work, it may be difficult to establish deep trust.
- Clients want to know: *"Have you been to the territory you're guiding me into?"*
- This doesn’t mean sharing everything, but *authentic resonance* matters.

### Tal's Invitation: Pause and Reflect

**Tal:**
Let’s pause for a moment.
- How is all of this *landing* for you?
- Where is it *living in your body*, in your understanding?
- What *wisdom* is emerging before we rush into more techniques?

Let it stew.  

Feel the mythic thread weaving through everything Simon shared.

### Group Reflections

**Student 1:**
At first, I felt like I needed to *know everything* about people to do it "right."  
Now I realize: *the person will show me.*  
My job is curiosity, not omniscience.

**Student 2:**
I’m noticing how often I project my experiences onto others — assuming similarity.  
This session reinforced the need to *listen freshly* every time.

**Student 3:**
I'm grateful that *this reverent, humanistic foundation* is the basis of our training.  
Not reducing clients to checklists — but honoring them as whole beings.

**Student 4 (Samantha):**
My current job as an investigator mirrors this:  
- Listening deeply to life stories.
- Seeing how circumstances shaped someone’s actions.
- Staying *curious*, not judgmental.

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly.  
Holding space with *presence and reverence* is the root of the work.
