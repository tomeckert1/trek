### Why "Finding Mythic Ground"?

**Simon Yugler:**
I'm calling this lecture *Finding Mythic Ground* because we're going to talk about *story* — and what we’re actually receiving when we engage with clients during preparation and intake.

We are *entering into a world* — *their* world.  
That’s why I’m framing this as stepping into *mythic territory*.

### Objectives for This Talk

**Simon Yugler:**
Here’s what I hope you’ll take away today:
- Explore the role of *personal and collective mythologies* in psychedelic preparation.
- Understand the *biopsychosocial* and *ADRESSING* frameworks for client intake.
- Begin developing *practical skills* for hearing client stories and orienting to their world.

We’ll get increasingly refined and granular as we move through this training module.
