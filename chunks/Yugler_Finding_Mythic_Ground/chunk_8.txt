### Healing as Revisiting Story

**Simon Yugler:**
I like to think of healing this way:

> *Healing is revisiting and repairing personal and collective stories until we can begin to tell a new one.*

We circle around the wound, around the memory, around the myth — again and again — like Rilke says in the poem.

We don’t bulldoze the old story; we revisit it until something new can emerge.

### Journaling Exercise

**Simon Yugler:**
Take *10 minutes* to free-write on these prompts:

1. *What myths are you living in right now?*  
   *(Remember: myth doesn't mean "false." It means "story.")*

2. *What collective myths are influencing your life?*

3. *What kinds of stories do you see yourself helping clients navigate?*  
   *(Try to be specific.)*

**Simon Yugler:**
Does that make sense?  
*(Students nod.)*

Alright, take 10 minutes.

### Group Reflections After Journaling

**Simon Yugler:**
I'd love to hear one or two reflections.  
- What came up?
- What did you discover while journaling?

**Jay:**
I've practiced law for nearly thirty years, done thousands of intakes.  
It struck me — there are *similarities and differences* between those intakes and psilocybin intakes.
- In law, people come in crisis: DUI, aggravated murder, serious circumstances.
- In psilocybin work, someone might be in crisis, but they might also be doing well and want to deepen their growth.

Understanding *where someone is coming from* — their story — is crucial either way.

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly.  
Even in psilocybin facilitation, you'll meet people in *dire straits*, searching for a last resort.  
There’s always a story behind why someone arrives in front of you.

**Another Student:**
I’ve been unraveling from collective myths over the last five years.  
- Seeing the gap between the collective myths I was raised in and my personal myth now was really rewarding.
- Writing them down felt fun and empowering.

**Simon Yugler:**
Beautiful.  
That awareness will definitely come up when working with clients — noticing where their personal myth bumps against collective myths.

**Another Student:**
I got a little tripped up — how distinct are personal and collective myths?

But thinking about *aging and invisibility* — that myth of becoming invisible as we age — felt really powerful.
- If you accept it, it can be very painful.
- It’s a collective myth, but it deeply impacts personal identity too.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes.  
- The personal myth is intertwined with the collective myth.
- As Joseph Campbell said:  
  > *Myths are public dreams, and dreams are private myths.*

Our little stories and the big collective stories are deeply connected.
