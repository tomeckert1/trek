### Key Learning Points

**Simon Yugler:**
- *We cannot pre-know* everything about a client.
- *Stories emerge* in their own way, in their own time.
- *Relational presence* and *reverent curiosity* are the foundation.
- We *hold the container* from the very first interaction — not just on the medicine day.
- *Shadow material* will emerge; be prepared without needing to “fix” it.
- *Take your time.* Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.

### Next Steps

**Tal:**
Now, we shift gears.

Over the next sessions, we will move into:
- *Practical intake tools*
- *Skill-building exercises* to listen with the "third ear"
- *Practice scenarios* to deepen your relational presence

You already have the most important thing:
> The reverent heart that holds the unfolding human story with care.

Now, we’ll work on techniques to support that heart-centered approach.

### Closing Words

**Simon Yugler:**
Thank you all again.

Remember:  
- Mythic ground is always beneath the surface.
- Every client is a living, breathing story.  
- Every preparation session is a sacred act of listening.

Take your time.  
Trust the unfolding.

We'll meet you there.
