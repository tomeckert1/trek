### Working with the Unconscious
  
**Simon Yugler:**
When we engage in psychedelic preparation and intake, we are stepping into *the unconscious* realm of our clients.

There are two major layers:
- *Personal Unconscious* — the client’s individual experiences, traumas, beliefs, forgotten memories.
- *Collective Unconscious* — the deep structures we all share as human beings (a Jungian concept).

**Important:**
- We are *not trying to therapize* trauma at this stage.  
- We are *witnessing* and *gathering* awareness of what’s present.

### The Shadow

**Simon Yugler:**
The *Shadow* is a key idea from Jungian psychology:
- It is the "dark side of the moon" of our consciousness.

**Important:**
- It’s not necessarily “bad”; it's just what is *unseen*, *disowned*, or *outside* of awareness.
- Everyone has a shadow.
  
In preparation, we are:
- Learning about someone's conscious and unconscious material.
- Holding awareness that there are parts of the person (and of ourselves) that are hidden from immediate view.
- Preparing to meet whatever may arise when the psychedelic medicine lifts the veil.

**Student Question:**
> What happens if someone’s shadow stays unconscious?

Until we make the unconscious conscious,  
it will direct our lives,  
and we will call it fate.
