### Introduction

**Simon Yugler:**
Alright, thanks everyone.

I like to open up the groups and the talks that I do with a little poetry. This one is short enough that it's firmly etched in my mind at this point. I'm going to read it to help us drop into a reflective space — it applies to this lecture, and to the moment we just shared with Dan.

This is a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke called *Widening Circles*:

> *I live my life in widening circles that move out across the world.  
I don't know if I'll complete this last one, but I will give myself to it.  

I circle around God, around the primordial tower, and I still don't know —  
Am I a falcon, a storm, or a great song?*

We'll come back to how this poem applies to what I'll be teaching today. For now, just let it sink into your subconscious.

### Lecture Intention and Overview

**Simon Yugler:**
Before I launch into the lecture, I want to set the stage:

Today, we're diving deeper into the topic of *preparation and intake*.  

My intention is to offer a *high-level, broad view* right now — we’ll get more granular as the day goes on.  

This might feel a little philosophical — that's on purpose.

Also, just to take the temperature of the room:  
Everyone here probably has a different tolerance level for "woo."  
Let's do a quick check-in:

- Middle of the road "woo"?
- Minimal woo?
- Full "give me all the woo" woo?

*(Students raise hands.)*

Joe’s got two hands up.  
Jay is like, "Nah."

Cool. Just wanted to get a sense — because although today's talk might sound a little "woo," it's really more about offering a *broad frame* for understanding the preparation process.
