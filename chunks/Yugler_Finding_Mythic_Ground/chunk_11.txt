| Biological  | Age, race, sex, health conditions |

| Psychological | Mindset, beliefs, traumas, thought patterns |
| Social      | Family, relationships, class, community factors |

Each layer forms someone's *set* — the internal and external conditions they bring into the psychedelic process.

Each layer carries *stories* — not just facts.

### ADDRESSING Framework

**Simon Yugler:**
Another useful tool is the *ADDRESSING framework*.  

It helps you check your own biases and expand your understanding of a client’s identity.

*ADDRESSING stands for:*
- *A*ge and generational influences
- *D*isability status (developmental)
- *D*isability status (acquired: physical, cognitive, psychological)
- *R*eligion and spiritual orientation
- *E*thnicity and race

*ADDRESSING stands for:*
- *S*ocioeconomic status
- *S*exual orientation
- *I*ndigenous heritage
- *N*ational origin
- *G*ender identity

Each category is a *portal to deeper understanding*.  

Each holds *layers of personal myth and collective myth*.
  
When I look back at my own facilitation missteps, it’s often because I *neglected* or *glossed over* one of these ADDRESSING categories.
