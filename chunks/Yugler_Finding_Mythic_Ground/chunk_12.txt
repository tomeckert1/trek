### Discussion: Examples of Missteps

**Tamara:**
Can you give an example of a misstep?

**Simon Yugler:**
Sure.
- Working with Tal, who's from Israel — if I just assumed our national identities were similar because we're both Westerners, that's a misstep.
- If I use American cultural references casually without considering whether Tal shares them, it could cause disconnection.
- Especially in a vulnerable state (like on mushrooms), that small disconnection can evoke major emotional reactions.

# Tal's Insight on Misattunement

**Tal:**
Actually, the worst wounding I've had with therapists came from *assumptions*.
- Assuming sameness can be just as harmful as assuming difference.
- It's about letting someone's story *unfold in front of you* — not projecting onto them from news, stereotypes, or your own past experiences.

**Simon:**
Exactly.
- *Curiosity* is the medicine.
- We honor the sacredness of someone's emerging story.

### The Power of Story

**Another Student:**
In research, subjects can answer demographic questions — but answering doesn't make you *seen*.
- If we just collect data points — age, gender, etc. — we miss the *living, breathing story* inside those facts.
- Real relationship asks us to *connect* to the vibrant, changing, complex human being in front of us.

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly.  
That’s why we excavate — not to fill out a form, but to enter the *mythic field* of someone's lived experience.

### Being Curious, Not Projecting

**Another Student:**
Sometimes a client will answer vaguely.  
I’ve learned not to interpret for them — but to *stay curious*:
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What does that mean for you?"

This keeps me from mapping my own experiences onto their words.

**Simon Yugler:**
Beautiful.  
*Curiosity before interpretation.* Always.

### Preparing for Complexity

**Simon Yugler:**
Relationality is complex.  
Stories are complex.  

Myth is complex.
- It’s not linear.
- It’s not clean.
- It’s alive.

This work asks us to *tolerate complexity* — and to honor it.
