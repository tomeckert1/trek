### The Central Questions of Preparation

**Simon Yugler:**
As we venture into this inner realm, we (and our clients) must ask:
> *Who am I?*  
> *Where do I come from?*

These seem like simple questions — but they are *core to the preparation process*.

In my upcoming book, I write:  
> *Approaching psychedelics from a disoriented place will only result in further disorientation.*

That’s why I emphasize *orientation*.  
Preparation centers both:
- The *client's relationship* to their own experience.
- *Our relationship* as facilitators to the client and the process.

We are helping the client *center*, *ground*, and *orient* before stepping into altered states.

### Question: Trauma and Disorientation

**Megan:**
Are you saying that if someone's approaching psychedelics from a disoriented, chaotic place — like active trauma or upheaval — it's risky?

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly.

If someone is:
- In active trauma response,
- In major upheaval (no job, no stable housing, etc.),
it’s not ideal to move forward right away.  

Instead, the preparation might become *a longer process*:
- "Let's continue working together for a few months to stabilize."
- "Maybe we revisit the journey after more grounding is established."

Preparation is still happening, even if the journey gets postponed.  
*Disorientation compounds disorientation.*  
Orientation is crucial.
