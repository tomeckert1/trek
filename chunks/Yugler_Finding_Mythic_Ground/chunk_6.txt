### Excavating the Mythic Ground

**Simon Yugler:**
When we do this work, we need to excavate deeper than just the external landscape.  
We explore both:
- *The external realities*: Where they come from geographically, culturally, socially.
- *The internal realities*: Their inner experiences, wounds, beliefs, dreams.

Understanding these dimensions helps us:
- Discover the deeper context of someone's life circumstances.
- Understand the unique creation story of their family, their upbringing.
- Recognize the larger *cultural narratives* informing their identity.

As Terrence McKenna once said:

> *"The world is made of language."*

I would add:  
> *The world is made of stories — and our language strings those stories together.*

### Question: Excavating Client Stories

**Student:**
When you say we need to excavate many layers deeper — inside and outside — to find someone's mythic ground, do you mean:
- Excavating inside of ourselves?
- Or helping the client excavate their own story to show us?

**Simon Yugler:**
Good question. I mean *the latter*.

In preparation, our role is to *work with clients* to excavate their layers.  
When someone says, "I grew up in a crazy family," that's a breadcrumb.
- What does "crazy" mean to them?
- What's the deeper story?

We don't therapize it at this stage — but *understanding it* is essential.

Especially if someone is working on relationships, family dynamics, attachment — their mythic ground becomes the doorway.
