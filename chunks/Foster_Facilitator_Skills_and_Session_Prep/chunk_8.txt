### Reaffirming Agreements and the Role of the Service Center

**Simon Yugler:**
Normally we would revisit the agreements — especially safety agreements — prior to this moment. But again, ideally all of that happens before the client even arrives for their session. By the time we get here, it’s about holding presence, not managing logistics.

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah. I’m curious what’s landing for folks. Any reflections or thoughts?

### Q&A: Music, Logistics, and Ritual

**Student 1:**
You mentioned a playlist. Do you provide the playlist or ask the client to?

**Simon Yugler:**
I usually provide it. Sometimes people think they know what they want, but that may not serve the depth of the experience.  
For example — people might say they want to listen to 1974 Grateful Dead… but do they really?

**Student 1:**
Do you include lyrics?

**Simon Yugler:**
I’m extremely cautious and intentional with lyrics. Any lyrics that appear in a track are there *for a reason*. It’s very sparing.

**Student 2:**
So in the role play, you handed Jason the mushrooms. But in Oregon, is that how it works?

**Simon Yugler:**
No — in Oregon, technically, facilitators don’t hand over the medicine.  
That’s the job of the service center representative — sometimes called the *liminal liaison* or (jokingly) the *mushroom fairy*.

Sometimes the dose is already in the room when the client enters. It’s subtle.

**Student 3:**
Does the client buy the mushrooms at that moment?

**Simon Yugler:**
Absolutely not.  
No financial transactions during this sacred moment. No talk about money. No reminders about calling 911. That stuff is handled *well before* the administration session.

**Lisa Snyder:**
Yeah, from a liminal liaison perspective:  
When a client arrives, I greet them, have them remove their coat, check their ID (to confirm they’re over 21), and handle the mushroom payment.  
Then they settle in. The facilitator enters once all of that is complete.  
In Colorado, facilitators *can* legally handle and distribute mushrooms — but it’s different in Oregon.
