### Opening Remarks and Grounding Meditation

**Jason Foster:**
It's good to see everybody. It's been a while.

Welcome to Intensive Number Three. We're going to be getting into the meat of this work today — actual facilitation skills. We’ll give you a chance to do some role plays. Simon and I are going to talk about skills for administration sessions, and Simon’s going to talk about set and setting, as well as preparation of the facilitator.

One of the themes in facilitation is *leaning in* and *leaning back* — being active or passive. So I want to start with a meditation.

Please get comfortable. Sit with a straight spine, feet on the ground. Close or defocus your eyes.

Start by taking a nice deep inhalation.  

**Jason Foster:**
And just relax the exhale, maybe make some sound.  
One more inhale...  
Noticing how the exhale is letting go.  
One more inhale and exhale...

Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground.  
Notice how your sit bones make contact with the chair.  

**Jason Foster:**
Feel the rhythm of your breath.

Notice what’s alive in you right now.  
Maybe you're carrying some “do-do-do” energy — rushing to get here — or some excitement.  
Maybe you're thinking about something that happened earlier or something in the future.  
Just notice that.  
Then return to your breath and the felt experience of this moment.

**Jason Foster:**
Now notice your back body.  
Are there any sensations in your back body?  
Let your awareness rest there.  
Energetically lean back. Abide.

In this moment, there's nothing to do.  
Your awareness is still aware, but you're resting here.

**Jason Foster:**
Notice any impulse to look around or lean forward. Let it be, and lean back again.  
Maintain that energetic stance.

Become aware of your heart — that bundle of nerves in your chest.  
Notice what’s present there.

Now bring awareness to your gut.  
Is there instinctual awareness or information from your gut?  

**Jason Foster:**
Maybe nothing, or maybe it’s saying “you’re safe right now.” Or maybe something else.

Again, take a breath.  
Relax the exhale.  
Notice your back body, heart, gut, mind chatter, and your feet on the ground.  
Just be in that abiding awareness.

Start to feel the air on your skin.  

**Jason Foster:**
Notice the sounds around you.  
Gently bring your awareness outward, back into the room.  
Open your eyes.  
Look around.  
Turn and look behind you — twist your torso.  
Activate your social brain.

**Jason Foster:**
This phrase I want to leave you with: *abiding presence*.  
We’ll come back to that throughout the day.
