### Continued Demonstration: Client Intake and Ritual Opening

**Jason Foster (as Client):**
Yeah. When you said "I got you," I just felt myself soften. Some emotion came up around that.  
In our prep, we talked about tools for when I feel lost. That phrase — "I got you" — could be really helpful to hear in those moments.

**Simon Yugler (as Facilitator):**
Beautiful. That’s great. I’ll remember that.

Did you bring any personal items you’d like to have out during our session?

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah. I brought this little Ganesh statue.

**Simon Yugler:**
Nice. What does Ganesh mean to you?

**Jason Foster:**
Ganesh is about removing obstacles. So, removing whatever’s in the way of me feeling what I need to feel — maybe letting that go, to lighten the load.

**Simon Yugler:**
Beautiful. Let’s invite Ganesh to help with that.

You’ve spoken about working through depression. Has anything changed or evolved in terms of your intention for today?

**Jason Foster:**
I still want to move through the depression. I want to find my light again — that lightness, that aliveness. I get glimpses, but the heaviness keeps returning. I want to shed that.

**Simon Yugler:**
I see that for you. I hope that happens. And again — I got you.  
Also, the medicine has got you. This medicine has been with humankind for millennia. It’s here for you, too.
