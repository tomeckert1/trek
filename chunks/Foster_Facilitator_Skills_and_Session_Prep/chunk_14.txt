### Rental Models and Service Center Fees

**Student 16:**
What are the logistics of working under the rental model in Oregon?  
Are facilitators paying for the room and the service center rep separately?

**Lisa (InnerTrek):**
- Every service center is a bit different.  
- Generally, under the *rental model*, facilitators:
  - Schedule dates with the service center.
  - *Collect payment* from their clients (for their services *and* the room).
  - *Pay the service center* out of that fee.
- Rates can vary:  
  - *Single room*: $250–$700/day.  
  - *Group room*: $1,000–$1,500/day.

- That rental fee *includes*:
  - The room.
  - Lights, heat, basic amenities.
  - The *liminal liaison* (service center representative).

- *Mushrooms are always a separate purchase*, paid in *cash* by the client.
