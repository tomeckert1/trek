### Power Dynamics and Client Empowerment

**Student 8:**
You said “I got you” in the demo, and it really landed. But could that create a power dynamic?  
Could we instead encourage the client’s own self-resource — like “you’ve got you”?  
How do you balance that?

**Simon Yugler:**
Great question.  
In that moment, it felt appropriate because Jason was expressing fear about being overwhelmed.  
It was less about taking responsibility for him and more about *reassurance through presence*.  

You're right though — that *can* veer into directive territory if we’re not mindful.  
But the phrase “I got you” can still be empowering if it’s said as:  
- “I’m with you.”  
- “You’re not alone.”  
Not: “I’ll fix this for you.”  

Facilitators should avoid over-promising.  
We’re not rescuers — we’re co-regulators and companions.

**Student 9:**
To me, Simon wasn’t saying “I’ll save you” — he was saying “I’m right here with you.”  
That’s what was reassuring — not directive.

**Jason Foster:**
Right. It’s not about eliminating darkness.  
It’s saying, “I’m present while you face it.”  
That can actually support autonomy, not diminish it.
