### Rituals and Timing After Dosing

**Student 4:**
So is there a prompt for clients to use the restroom before the session starts?

**Simon Yugler:**
Yeah, definitely. Either just before this ritual moment or right after dosing.  
It’s part of settling in — making sure they’re comfortable in all ways.

There are layers of entering the container.  
- One is the logistical: coat off, ID, payment.  
- The next is what we just demonstrated — a deeper, more intentional energetic entry into the experience.  
By the time we’re in that space, logistics are done.

**Student 5:**
You joked about waiting twenty minutes after the medicine. What do you actually do in that window?

**Simon Yugler:**
Some clients go straight into the playlist and settle in.  
Some sit in silence.  
Some want to keep chatting — which I usually let go for a bit and then gently suggest it might be time to lay down.  
Other options include:
- Gentle stretching or light yoga  
- Guided meditation  
- Breathing together  
It all depends on the client and what they need.

### Optional Creative Rituals

**Student 6:**
Could I bring in something like art or tarot cards during that twenty-minute window?

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes — 100%.  
You can be creative. That time is flexible.  
Some people like to draw, journal, pull cards, or sit in meditation.  
Personally, once the medicine is out, I treat that as a shift into sacred space.  
It’s like a Native American Church idea: once the medicine is in the room, the quality of space shifts. You don’t just walk around casually.  

But that’s just my take — others work differently.

**Student 7:**
If we’re not in a licensed service center — say, in Colorado — how does the client get the medicine?

**Jason Foster:**
That’s a bit of a catch-22.  
In Oregon, it’s illegal to work outside of a licensed service center as a facilitator.  
In Colorado, there *is* an option for at-home services, but it still has to be under the umbrella of a licensed service center.  
The facilitator there can legally handle the mushrooms, but it’s still regulated.
