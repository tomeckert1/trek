### Debrief and Reflections on Ritual and Set & Setting

**Simon Yugler:**
So yeah… "down the hatch" — a little different from this, right?

This was kind of a streamlined or pared-down version of a ritual.  
I'll be giving a talk this afternoon on *set and setting*, and what ritual can look like.

This whole day is a ritual. But you’ll notice we didn’t use bells or shakers — this was subtle.  
Still, there was a clear signal to both the client and the space that we are stepping into a different quality of presence.

There are flashier ways to do this, but it can also be incredibly simple and intentional.
