### Facilitator Cancellations and Capacity

**Student 14:**
Have you ever had to cancel on a client day-of, and how do you handle that?

**Jason Foster:**
I don’t remember doing it, but it’s always possible.  
If I’m too sick or unwell to be fully present, I might cancel — but I try to weigh that carefully.  
Also, I would inform the client and give them the option to reschedule or decide based on their own comfort.

It’s important to have a *clear cancellation policy*, but I don’t offer discounts or refunds for facilitator illness unless it feels necessary.

### Frequency of Facilitation and Burnout

**Student 15:**
How frequently do you facilitate, and how much space do you give yourself between clients?

**Jason Foster:**
- It ebbs and flows.  
- At my peak: up to *6 sessions/month* — that felt okay, but tiring.  
- More sustainable: *3–4 sessions/month*.  
- It depends on how much space I have in my life and how I care for myself.  
- Everyone has a different constitution for how much they can hold.

**Simon Yugler:**
- In Jamaica, we did one week on, one week off.  
- During one stretch with *no off days*, I got *deeply burned out* — to a level I didn’t know existed.  
- So yeah, *start slow*.  
- If you’re new, I’d recommend *no more than 2 sessions/month* for the first 3–6 months to get a feel for your limits.

### Income and Sustainable Practice

**Jason Foster:**
- When this question comes up, I sense a ripple of anxiety.  
- Let’s take a quick show of hands:  
  _How many of you hope this becomes your primary source of income?_  
  _(Some hands go up.)_

- It’s *challenging* to rely solely on facilitation for income, especially early on.  

**Jason Foster:**
- Adjacent skills help: breathwork, counseling, integration support.  
- The more support you can offer *outside of the administration day*, the more sustainable your practice becomes.
