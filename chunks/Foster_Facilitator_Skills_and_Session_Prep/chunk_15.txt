**Student 17:**
Are the mushrooms in pill form or whole?

**Simon Yugler:**
- In Oregon, they are *whole mushrooms*.
- I just still think in pill form because of Jamaica habits.

**Student 18:**
Do clients make tea, eat them whole, or are there options?

**Jason Foster:**
- Yes, they can:
  - Eat them directly.
  - Make tea.
  - Choose based on what feels right.
- I’ll talk more about the *rituals and options* later today.

### Reflecting on the Balance Between Logistics and Presence

**Simon Yugler:**
Just a note:  
- All these logistical questions are *essential and necessary*.  
- But it's interesting to observe how *easily we pivot* toward numbers and logistics.  
- The *point of the role play* was to demonstrate how to *step out of that space*—into the relational and ritual container.

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah, I think it’s not wrong that these questions come up.  
But the *impulse* to get into details is strong, and we should notice that in ourselves.  
This moment is not for details—it’s about *presence* and *connection*.

### Facilitator-Client Comfort and Emotional Containment

**a student**  
In the roleplay, I noticed how much of the interaction was about establishing *comfort* and *reminding the client* of their intention.  

It felt like you were *tamping down anxiety* rather than introducing new elements.

**Jason Foster:**
Yes, that’s right.  
The *foundation is already built* in prior prep sessions.  
In this moment, we’re simply *reminding the client* that foundation is there.  
Letting them feel their *feet on it*.  
Helping them feel it’s *sturdy* and *safe*.

## Closing Acknowledgment

**Simon Yugler:**
Great. Well, thank you everyone for your attention and participation today.  
We’re really looking forward to *building on this experience* in the next intensives.  
Thanks for the questions, thanks for the presence, and thanks for stepping into this with us.
