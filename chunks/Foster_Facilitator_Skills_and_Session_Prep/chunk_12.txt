### Preparation and Client Guidelines

**Student 11:**
Do you offer some kind of syllabus or checklist about how a session typically runs?

**Jason Foster:**
Yes — not in this *moment*, but in the overall training.  
There are documents in Section 2 or 3 of the course that include:  
- Preparation checklists  
- Session flow guidelines  
- Safety protocols

**Student 11:**
Okay — I’ll look for those.

**Simon Yugler:**
Oscar had a question earlier.

**Oscar (Student 12):**
If you open your own service center, can you serve as both the facilitator and the person distributing the mushrooms?

**Lisa (InnerTrek staff):**
In Oregon:  
- You can own a service center and be a facilitator.  
- But the person handing over the mushrooms must be a *Service Center Representative (SCR)*, also called the *liminal liaison*.  
- You can’t fulfill both roles simultaneously during a session.

### Clarifying Safety Language

**Lisa:**
To clarify earlier — the “911” clause is in the *Client Bill of Rights*.  
It says something like:  
> “Leaving mid-session could expose you to safety and legal risks.”

It’s part of harm reduction:  
- Clients under the influence may harm themselves or others.  
- A call to emergency services might be a necessary safeguard.

But again: this is all communicated *before* the medicine is introduced.

### Service Across State Lines

**Student 13:**
If I live in Washington and I’m licensed in Oregon, can I bring my clients across state lines to work with them in a licensed Oregon service center?

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes, absolutely.  
- People fly in from all over the world.  
- As long as you’re licensed in Oregon, you can serve clients who travel from other states (or countries).  
- One example: Someone flew in from Japan to visit the InnerTrek service center.

**Jason Foster:**
And starting January 1, 2025, Oregon will also allow *out-of-state licensees* — so things are opening up even more.
