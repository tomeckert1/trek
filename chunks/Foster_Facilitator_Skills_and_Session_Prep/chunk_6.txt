### Introducing the Medicine

**Simon Yugler:**
So, we’d talked about something around 35 milligrams, or about five grams. How does that feel now?

**Jason Foster:**
I don’t really know what that means exactly, but I trust you. You know me well enough to know what I’m ready for.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yeah. I think it’s a good dose.

I’m going to give you the medicine now. Just hold it in your hand and connect with it in your own way. We’ll take some breaths together before you ingest it.  
Even though it looks like a pill, it’s very much alive.

Maybe take a breath and think about everything that brought you to this moment — everything we’ve talked about and you’ve shared.

You can put your intention into the mushroom. You can ask it for something. Ask your body to welcome it. Or check in with how it feels in your hand.

**Jason Foster:**
It feels good.

**Simon Yugler:**
Good. Take a few more breaths in silence.

**Jason Foster:**
Feels like a big deal.

**Simon Yugler:**
It is. Whenever you're ready, there's water right there. You can take the medicine.

**Jason Foster:**
Should I take one piece at a time?

**Simon Yugler:**
Whatever feels right.

**Jason Foster:**
(holds up Ganesh) Drink from Ganesh.  
Water removes all boundaries.

Should I lay down or something?

**Simon Yugler:**
You can. Or you can sit in meditation as it comes on. You’re welcome to start the playlist too — whatever feels good.

**Jason Foster:**
I think I want to lay down.

**Simon Yugler:**
Great. I’ll be right here. Bon voyage.

**Jason Foster:**
Should we wait 20 minutes for it to kick in?

**Simon Yugler:**
Yeah. It’s not awkward or anything.

**Jason Foster:**
(laughs) That was lovely. When you said “I got you,” it really landed for me.

**Simon Yugler:**
Good. I felt it too.
