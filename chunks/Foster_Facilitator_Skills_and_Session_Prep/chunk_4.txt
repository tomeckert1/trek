### Demonstration: Client Arrival and Beginning a Session

**Jason Foster:**
We’re going to switch gears — Simon is going to join me.

**Simon Yugler:**
Good morning, everyone.

So, this is something Jason and I have never done in an intensive, but we've done many times in real life. We've never demonstrated what it might actually look and feel like when a client walks in for their administration session. After all the prep and orientation — this is the moment when they walk into the space. It's a very special moment.

I remember when I was working in Jamaica, the CEO of the company — charismatic, irreverent British guy — would gather everyone and say, "Alright everyone, well, down the hatch!" before taking medicine. I was mortified. That’s not it.

So I started being more intentional. Bringing people into that charged, sacred moment with presence.

Jason and I are going to role-play this.

**Simon Yugler:**
Assume we’ve done all the prep — multiple sessions, intake, all that — and Jason is walking into the service center to begin.

**Jason Foster (as Client):**
(knocks) Hey Simon.

**Simon Yugler (as Facilitator):**
Hi Jason. Welcome. How are you doing?

**Jason Foster:**
I’m good. Excited... and a little nervous?

**Simon Yugler:**
Cool. Good. Want to come sit down?

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah, thanks.

**Simon Yugler:**
So, how are you feeling today?

**Jason Foster:**
I got okay sleep. I think I was nervous, so didn’t sleep great. But I’m looking forward to this. It’s scary, but I think I’m ready.

**Simon Yugler:**
Tell me about the nervousness?

**Jason Foster:**
I think I’m afraid of it getting dark or out of control — that I won’t be able to stop it. That’s scary.

**Simon Yugler:**
Let’s talk about that. What are we going to do if it gets dark?  
Darkness and light coexist, right?

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah, I think it’s tied to the depression I’ve talked about. I’m afraid it will overwhelm me. I’ll get lost.  
I know we’ve talked about turning toward it, going through the door, so I’m willing... but what if it’s too much?

**Simon Yugler:**
That makes sense. In my own experience — and in facilitating others — I’ve never seen this medicine give someone more than they can handle.  
Nothing over the line of “too much.”  
I’ve never seen anyone get into a place we couldn’t get through.

**Jason Foster:**
That’s helpful. But how do we get through it?

**Simon Yugler:**
We’ll get through it — *we*.  
I’ll be with you, in whatever comes up.

I haven't talked much about my own experiences because we’ve been focused on you. But I’ll say: I won’t take you to a place I haven’t been myself.  
I’ve seen some shit. I got you.
