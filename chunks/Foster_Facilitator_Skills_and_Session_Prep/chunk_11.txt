### Logistics Around Safety and Consent

**Student 10:**
Wait — is the “calling 911” thing actually real?

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes.  
It’s not something to bring up right before dosing, but it’s in Oregon’s safety planning policies.  
The idea is: if a client leaves the center mid-journey, we have a duty to ensure safety — which could include emergency services.

But the point is:  
*Don’t bring that up during the sacred moment of dosing.*  

**Simon Yugler:**
All safety agreements, logistics, payment, etc., should be *handled well before* the client takes the medicine.

**Jason Foster:**
This is about attunement.  
You don't talk about logistics, threats, or money once you're in the medicine space.  
That’s misattuned and potentially harmful.
