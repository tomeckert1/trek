### Routes of Administration

**Jason Foster:**  
Let’s now talk about *routes of administration*. As you saw in the images, the mushrooms are available as *raw, dried mushrooms*.

You can:
- *Grind* them and mix into *tea*
- Blend them into a *smoothie* (usually with orange juice)
- Serve raw mushrooms with *honey* or *ginger juice*

*Tea benefits:*
- Slightly *faster onset*
- *Mitigates nausea*
- Clients *don’t have to eat* the slimy mushroom pieces
  
That said, if you’re not consuming all of the mushroom material, you may *lose a bit of potency*. Just something to consider when calculating dosage.

*Smoothies:*
- Orange juice *tastes better*, helps mask the mushroom flavor
- But too much orange juice can *slow digestion*
- We’re not trying to make it “delicious,” just *palatable*

### Prohibited Practices

**Jason Foster:**  
We are *not allowed* to use:
*Smoothies:*
- *Lemon tek*  
  (That’s when you soak mushrooms in lemon juice to convert psilocybin to psilocin ahead of time. It helps with digestion but is considered chemical alteration.)
- *Cannabis*  
  Not allowed at all in service centers.
- *Chocolate or cacao*  
  These *enhance the effects* of mushrooms. So they’re generally prohibited because they *chemically enhance* the experience.

### Q&A

**Student:**
For smoothies — do they have supplies at the service center, or do we bring them?

**Jason Foster:**
That’s a good question. Lisa?

**Lisa:**
We *do not* have smoothie supplies.  
We *do* have *tea-making supplies*, but we don’t have a *grinder* on site.  
Facilitators usually bring their own grinder.

**Student:**
What exactly does chocolate do?

**Jason Foster:**
It *enhances the effects*. I can’t quite recall the pharmacology, but it’s *synergistic* — meaning *1 + 1 = 3*, not 2.

**Lisa Snyder:**
Here’s how psilocybin is metabolized:

1. You *chew* the mushrooms — enzymes in your saliva begin digestion
2. Mushrooms go to your *gut*, then into the *bloodstream*
3. Blood goes through your *liver*, which converts *psilocybin into psilocin*
4. Psilocin is the *active molecule* that binds to receptors and causes the psychedelic effects

*Factors that influence absorption:*
- *Age* (older adults have slower heart rate and digestion)
- *Diabetes* or undiagnosed *liver issues*
- General *gut motility*

### Chocolate Use in Service Centers

**Jason Foster:**
I wasn’t sure what’s in the chocolate exactly, but I know it’s synergistic. Again, that means it *enhances the effect*, more than just adding to it — 1 + 1 = 3.

You’re hired. I gotta put this in my slides.
