### Analyte vs. Equivalent

**Jason Foster:**
There’s a difference between:
- *Psilocybin analyte*: measures only psilocybin.
- *Total psilocybin equivalent*: includes psilocybin *and* psilocin.

This batch is kind of a weird example — it doesn’t have *any psilocin* in it.  
So the *psilocybin analyte* and *TPE* are the same.

But that’s *not* going to be true for every batch.

### Clarifying Terminology and Formulas

**Jason:**
Let’s clarify. If there were psilocin in the mushroom, we’d need to go to the *TPE* number and multiply that by the *weight*.

**Participant:**
So the analyte is just what's measured?

**Jason:**
Yes. And the “equivalent” includes psilocin effects.  
In this case, the TPE is *5.76 mg/g*.

To calculate the *TPE*, you:
- Take the psilocin (mg/g)
- Multiply it by *1.4*
- Add that to the psilocybin (mg/g)

That gives you the *effective dose* as if it were all psilocybin.
