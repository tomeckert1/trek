### Practical Service Center Use

**Jason Foster:**
In the service center:
- We round up the 9.96 mg to 10 mg.
- So if someone wants a 25 mg dose, the liaison preps enough bags to add up to that.

Starting January, we also need to *inform clients* about psilocin content — even if we don’t always know the exact number.

It’s something that’s just coming into wider awareness, but it matters.

### Practical Implications of Psilocin

**Jason Foster:**
If the mushroom has *a lot of psilocin*, and you're *only looking at the psilocybin analyte*, you could *underestimate* the potency — and give someone too strong of a dose.

For example, that “morphic blob” strain has a *huge amount* of psilocin — nearly doubles the effective strength.

So *don’t ignore* the TPE if it's available.

### A Note on Satori Farms

**Jason Foster:**
All the samples we’ve seen from Satori Farms so far have *no psilocin*.

I’m not sure how they managed that — maybe it's due to hybridization. Tori (from Satori) said they're all crossbred strains.

So maybe in practice we won’t see much psilocin, and the *analyte number* will be fine.  
But I want you to *be aware* that psilocin could still show up in other batches or farms.

### You’re Not Doing All the Math

**Jason Foster:**
Also, as Lisa mentioned — *you are not the one doing all the math* at the service center.

You can say to the liaison: “We’re taking 25 mg,” and they’ll prep it.

You’re just double-checking the math. Like: “Does this add up to 25 mg? Okay, good.”

Take the pressure off — you don’t need to do complex calculations when you’re holding space for someone.

### Estimating Potency from Grams

**Participant:**
If one gram of mushrooms usually has about 10 mg of psilocybin, why does it look like this batch has less — almost 2 grams for just 10 mg?

**Jason Foster:**
Great observation. That earlier example was for a mushroom with *1% psilocybin*, which equals *10 mg per gram*.

But most *psilocybe cubensis* strains range from *0.5% to 0.9% total tryptamines*, so they're often *less than 10 mg per gram*.

That batch you're referring to had *1.73 grams* and just under *10 mg*, which fits within that typical range.

### Shifting From Grams to Milligrams

**Jason Foster:**
This shift from grams to milligrams might take some recalibration.

You’re used to thinking: “I took 3 grams,” but what *milligram dose* did that translate to? We don’t really know.

When you’re in *practicum*, you’ll be told *exact milligram doses*, so take note:  
“What does 10 mg feel like? 15 mg? 20 mg?”  
That’ll help build internal calibration.

So when clients say, “I took 3 grams,” you can reply,  
“We’re giving you 20 mg, which is probably *approximately* similar.”

But again, we can’t be precise without knowing the exact mushroom potency.
