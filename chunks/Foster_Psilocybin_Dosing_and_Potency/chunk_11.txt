### Clinical Dosing Benchmarks

**Jason Foster:**
- Most *depression studies* use about *25 mg* of psilocybin.
- Maximum in any study so far: *35 mg*.
- At the InnerTrek service center:
  - Typical range: *20–25 mg* for new clients.

- In *practicum*:
  - Range: *1–25 mg*
  - Average: *~15 mg*

### Jason's Recommendation

**Jason Foster:**
I’d say: for a *first journey*, start *conservatively* — maybe *15–20 mg*.

Simon, any thoughts?

**Simon:**
Depends on the person — past experiences, intention, sensitivity.  
I like Terrence McKenna’s advice: *“Take it easy, but take it.”*

**Jason Foster:**
Right — *3 to 5 grams*, or *25–35 mg*, is often a solid experience.

But some people have *strong reactions* even to 35 mg. That’s a lot.

### Practicum Dosing Clarification

**Participant:**
So in practicum, we’ll be at 15 mg?

**Jason:**
You’ll get to choose, up to *25 mg max*.
