### Summary of Label Sections

**Jason Foster:**
- *Red*: Potency (mg/g)
- *Blue*: Net weight (g)
- *Green*: Total active psilocybin (mg)

So potency × weight = *how much active compound* is in the sample.

This number helps us figure out what to give clients.

### Final Clarifications on Labels

**Participant:**
So if there was psilocin in this batch, the TPE would be higher?

**Jason Foster:**
Exactly. Even though the psilocybin analyte stays the same, the *TPE increases* if there’s psilocin.

**Participant:**
And in this batch, TPE × net weight = 9.96 mg — right?

**Jason Foster:**
Right. 5.76 mg/g × 1.73 g = 9.96 mg.

### Dosing Math Recap

**Participant:**
What's the difference between psilocybin analyte and total psilocybin equivalent?

**Jason Foster:**
- Psilocybin analyte = just psilocybin (in milligrams)
- Psilocybin equivalent = psilocybin + psilocin effects (in milligrams per gram)

You're solving for milligrams per gram, and eventually for *total milligrams* — which is what we care about when dosing.

### Visual Recap of the Label

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s break it down:
- *Red*: Potency (mg/g)
- *Blue*: Weight (g)
- *Green*: Total active ingredient (mg)

So:
- Red × Blue = Green
- That’s your *total dose* (active product)

We use this to determine how many milligrams of psilocybin-equivalent to give someone.

### Psilocin and Total Potential

**Participant:**
If there was psilocin in the batch, would the “total potential psilocybin” number be higher?

**Jason Foster:**
Yes. Both the total psilocybin equivalent and total potential psilocybin would be higher.

**Participant:**
But if there's no psilocin, shouldn't the TPE and analyte numbers be the same?

**Jason Foster:**
They are in this case.  
The TPE of 5.76 mg/g × 1.73 g = 9.96 mg — the same as the psilocybin analyte.
