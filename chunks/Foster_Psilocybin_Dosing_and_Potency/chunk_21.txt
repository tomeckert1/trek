### Dosing Summary and Practical Takeaways

**Jason Foster:**
So to *recap* — dosing mushrooms is *not* about grams.  
It’s about *milligrams of psilocybin* and *psilocin*, and more precisely, *total psilocybin equivalent* (TPE).

Here’s what we covered:

- 1 gram of mushrooms ≠ 1 consistent dose  
  Potency varies depending on species, strain, and *psilocin content*.
- *TPE* accounts for both psilocybin and psilocin and is the *best number* to guide dosage.
- You can calculate the actual *milligram dose* by multiplying the *TPE (mg/g)* by the *net weight (g)*.
- *Psilocin* makes mushrooms more potent — so batches with higher psilocin content may hit harder than expected.

### Best Practices

**Jason Foster:**
- Don’t stress about *doing the math*.  
  The *service center team* (like the liminal liaison) is responsible for prepping doses based on what you request — e.g., 25mg.
- But it’s still important that you *understand* the numbers enough to double-check and make sure your client’s getting what they need.
  
And again — if you’re giving 25 milligrams, and the batch has 9.96mg/g, you’d need a bit over *2.5 grams* to hit that target.  
That’s just an example.
  
Ultimately, the dosing strategy combines:
- *Label literacy*
- Understanding *client needs* and red/green flags
- Awareness of *psilocin effects*
- And readiness to *boost* thoughtfully if needed
