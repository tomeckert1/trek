### How Much to Boost?

**Jason Foster:**
**If client feels a little:**
- Give *20–30%* of the initial dose  
- Do *not* exceed *50 mg total*

**If client feels nothing:**
- Some protocols suggest *50% of initial dose*  
  - But this is *risky*  
  - Why? Because maybe it’s just *slow digestion*, not underdosing.

### Oregon Cautionary Tales

**Jason Foster:**
Some facilitators in Oregon made *mistakes*:

*If client feels nothing:*
- Misinterpreted slow onset as underdosing
- Gave another *50% dose*
- Client ended up *way too high*

This has especially happened with *elderly clients* (slower digestion), but it can affect anyone.

### An Alternative Protocol

**Jason Foster:**
One facilitator assumes *slow digestion*, not resistance or tolerance.

His approach:
1. Offer a *slice of fruit* to stimulate digestion
2. Wait a bit
3. Then offer a *tiny booster* — maybe *5% of the original dose*
   - It’s a *psychological trick* sometimes, but it works

### Final Tips on Boosting

**Jason Foster:**
- Don’t let your *impulse* to “give them an experience” override caution
- People can be *high without realizing it*
  - Watch for:
    - *Dilated pupils*
    - *Shifts in speech*
    - “I don’t think it’s working, but I see geometric patterns…”

If that’s happening:
- Invite them to *explore the visuals*
- Deepen their breathing
- This can help them *open into* the experience
