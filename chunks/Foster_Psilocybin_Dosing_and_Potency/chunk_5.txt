### How Psilocybin Works

**Jason Foster:**
This is all going to come together shortly.

Remember: Psilocybin **breaks down in the gut** and is **converted into psilocin**, and **psilocin is what gets us high**.

### Reading Labels: Old vs. New

**Jason Foster:**
Here’s an *older label*:
- Psilocybin: 10.2 mg/g  
- Psilocin: 1.96 mg/g  
- Net weight and total psilocybin analyte are listed.

*Key concept:* You multiply the **net weight** by the **psilocybin per gram** to get the **total psilocybin analyte**.

> *Note: "Analyte" just means the compound being measured in the lab. It’s not a special version of psilocybin — you can ignore that word.*
