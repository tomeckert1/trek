### Individual Factors that Affect Dosing

**Jason Foster:**
Several factors can help you estimate what dose to begin with:
- *Client’s intention:* How deep do they want to go?
- *Level model:* Light to entheogenic (Levels 1–5)
- *Green and red flags:* Green = go higher, red = go lower (but not always contraindicating)
- *Constitution:* If someone is particularly “defended” or closed, maybe *+20%*.
- *High sensitivity:* Maybe *reduce by 20–80%*.
  - Sensitive folks may feel effects at just *5–10 mg*.
- *Response to other substances:* Novocaine, caffeine, alcohol, psych meds.
- *Recent psych med use:*
  - May call for a *+20% boost*
  - The *more time off*, the *less adjustment needed*
  - *Wellbutrin* is an exception; might enhance psychedelics
- *Body weight:* Often dismissed, but sometimes seems relevant.
  - Bigger bodies may sometimes need more (though inconsistently)
