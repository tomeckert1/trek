### Psilocybin Dosing and Booster Recap

**Jason Foster:**
So, quick recap on what we've covered:
- Potency is measured in *milligrams of psilocybin*, not grams of mushrooms.
- *Psilocybin* is converted into *psilocin* in the body — psilocin is the compound that produces psychedelic effects.
- Lab labels now list *Total Psilocybin Equivalent (TPE)* — this includes psilocybin and psilocin (converted to psilocybin-equivalent using the 1.4 multiplier).
- Dosing is calculated by multiplying *TPE (mg/g)* by the *net weight (g)* to get the *total dose in milligrams*.
- Not all mushrooms have the same potency — hence the need to look at the *lab results*, not just the weight in grams.

### Practical Considerations for Facilitators

**Jason Foster:**
- *Start low* (e.g., 15–20 mg) if uncertain.
- *Adjust* for individual factors like:
  - Sensitivity
  - Trauma history
  - Recent psych med use
  - Body constitution
- *Boosting*:
  - Wait *at least an hour*, ideally *1.5 hours*, before boosting.
  - Work with *resistance or fear* before assuming more medicine is needed.
  - Use *breathwork*, *aromatherapy*, or *soothing support* before deciding to boost.
  - Boost with *~20–30%* of the original dose if needed (max 50 mg total).
  - If *no effects at all*, consider a *small booster* (e.g., 5%) — might be a *digestive delay*.
