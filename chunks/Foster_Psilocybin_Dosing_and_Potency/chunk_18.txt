### Routes of Administration

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s talk about the different *routes of administration* for psilocybin.

*1. Raw Dried Mushrooms*
- These are the most *basic* form.
- Can be:
  - *Eaten as-is*
  - *Ground up* and used in a *tea* or *smoothie*
  - Served with *honey* or *ginger juice*

*2. Tea*
- *Faster onset* than eating mushrooms whole
- Helps *reduce nausea*
- Clients don’t have to eat the *slimy mushroom bits*
- *Slight potency loss* if they don’t consume the solids

*3. Smoothie*
- Often made with *orange juice*
- Important: *Don’t use too much orange juice*  
  → It *slows digestion*
- May make the medicine more *palatable*, but we’re not trying to make it “delicious”
- Still useful for some clients

### Lemon Tekking — Not Allowed

**Jason Foster:**
*What is Lemon Tekking?*
- Mixing mushrooms with *lemon juice*
- Chemically converts *psilocybin to psilocin*
- Leads to *faster, stronger onset*
- Helpful for clients with *digestive issues*

*BUT*:  
- Lemon tekking is *not allowed*
- It *alters the chemical structure*, and that’s against current rules

### Other Prohibited Substances

**Jason Foster:**
- *Cannabis*: Not permitted in service centers
- *Chocolate/Cacao*:
  - Not officially allowed
  - Enhances the effects of psilocybin
  - May be *synergistic*
  - Some centers do *use tiny pieces* to help “wash it down”
