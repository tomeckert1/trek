### Introduction to Dosing

**Jason Foster:**
Dosing. You guys excited?

**Participant:**
Five grams, please!

**Jason Foster:**
No. No. We're going to be talking about this in milligrams, not grams.  
I want you to start thinking about the potency of mushrooms in milligrams and not grams.

We’ll get into why I’m saying that. But first, a quick reminder about the metric system:  
*1 gram = 1,000 milligrams*

We’re used to talking about grams of raw, dried mushrooms — and that is what we’ll be giving clients: *raw, dried mushrooms measured in grams*.  

But the *potency* is measured in *milligrams of psilocybin*.

And all the mushrooms are *lab tested*, so we know pretty much exactly how potent they are.

### Understanding Mushroom Potency

**Jason Foster:**
The average mushroom — this is from a Tripsitter article — contains *about 0.97% psilocybin*, or about *1% psilocybin*.  
Psilocin and baeocystin (I think that’s how you pronounce it) are also present.  
The average dried *Psilocybe cubensis* strain contains between *0.5% and 0.9% total tryptamines*.

We’ll get into more detail in a minute.

So, if a mushroom is *1% psilocybin*, then *1 gram* of the dried mushroom contains *10 mg of psilocybin*.
