### Strain Differences: Penis Envy and Hybrids

**Participant (Robin):**
I didn’t see *Penis Envy* on the strain list. Why?

**Jason Foster:**
Satori Farms *crossed* Penis Envy with other strains to create new ones — like *Louis Vuitton* and *Enigma*.

So while *Penis Envy* isn’t listed by name, its *genetics are present* in some of the hybrid strains.

Why do that? Maybe for *stability, yield, or potency*. Some say Penis Envy has *very high psilocybin*, but these crosses may balance other traits too.

### Mushroom Appearance

**Jason Foster:**
Some of the mushrooms are *big*, some are *small* — you’ll see a lot of variation.

These are what the *mushroom fairy* will hand to your clients.
