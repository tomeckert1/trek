### Final Thoughts

**Jason Foster:**
- You don't have to do all the math — the *service center staff* helps with this.
- You do need to be able to *read the labels* and understand *what you're giving*.
- Always consider the *client’s needs*, but remember to *trust your intuition*.
- Don't underestimate the importance of *set and setting*, and their interaction with dose.
 
Thanks again, everyone.
