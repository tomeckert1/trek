### Psilocybin vs. Psilocin: Visual Breakdown

**Jason Foster:**
Here’s a chart showing average *Psilocybe cubensis* potencies.  
- *Dark green* represents psilocybin content.  
- *Light blue* represents psilocin content.

You may remember that mushrooms don’t just contain psilocybin — they also contain *psilocin* and some other chemicals like *baeocystin*, which typically aren’t measured in labs.

Note how a strain like *Morphic Blob* has *a lot of psilocin* relative to psilocybin.  
Versus a strain like *Malaysian*, which has an insignificant amount of psilocin.

### Strain Comparison: B+ Example

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s look at the *B+ strain* at the bottom of the chart:

- *Psilocybin*: 0.59% = 5.9 mg per gram  
- *Psilocin*: 0.11% = 1.1 mg per gram

So, the *active compounds* are:
- *85% psilocybin*
- *15% psilocin* (relative to each other)

That’s a *significant* amount of psilocin — not immense, but worth noting.
