### Facilitator Responsibilities with Administration

**Jason Foster:**
As we discussed earlier, *service center representatives* — aka the *mushroom fairies* — must:
- *Serve the mushrooms*
- Be present when the *client ingests them*
- Be present for *booster administration*

### More on Smoothies and Logistics
**Student:**
If someone’s making a smoothie, who puts the mushrooms in the blender?

**Jason Foster:**
Ah, yeah. The *client* has to do that. You *can’t* put it in for them.

**Student:**
Wait — so the *client* puts it in the blender?

**Jason Foster:**
Yes. Because you're technically *selling* it to them. Once the package is open, only the client can manipulate it. It’s a little awkward.

**Lisa Snyder:**
Same goes for *grinding* the mushrooms. The client has to do it.

**Jason Foster:**
Right. I’m not 100% on that part, but yeah — sounds right.

### Chocolate Use Clarified

**Lisa Snyder:**
Just to clarify — I don’t think it’s actually *in the rules* that chocolate is prohibited.  
We do use *tiny pieces of chocolate* in the service center, just enough to *wash down* the mushrooms.

**Jason Foster:**
Okay. That makes sense. My understanding was that the rule said you can’t use *anything that alters or enhances the chemical structure*. But yeah, it sounds like there’s some *room for interpretation*.

**Lisa Snyder:**
Exactly. It’s a bit of a gray area. Maybe you can *push* it a little.

**Jason Foster:**
Cool. Good to know. So just to be clear: *chocolate will enhance* the effects of the mushrooms a little bit.

### Colorado Rules Note
  
As I said earlier, in *Colorado*, the rules are mostly the same — except:
- For *in-home use*, the *facilitator* is the one who handles the mushrooms
- There are extra rules about how they must:
  - Get them from the service center
  - Transport and store them properly

That’s that.

Thank you.
