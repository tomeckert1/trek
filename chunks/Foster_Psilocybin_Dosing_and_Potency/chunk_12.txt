### Mapping Dosage to Levels

**Jason Foster:**
During intake, we go over the *Level 1–5 model*.
- *15 mg* might correspond to a *Level 1 or 2*.
- If someone has *lots of green flags*, maybe you go higher.
- If there are *red flags* (but not full contraindications), maybe you go lower.

### Boosting: What It Is and When to Do It

**Participant:**
You mentioned “boosting.” What is that?

**Jason Foster:**
Boosting is when you give an *additional dose after the initial one*. I’ll walk you through how and when to consider that.

### Facilitator Experience: Regret from a High Dose

**Participant:**
Have you or Simon ever regretted giving a client too much?

**Jason Foster:**
Yes. One client was *screaming like a two-year-old*.

**Simon:**
At a retreat in Mexico with Erica, we had someone with *yellow/orange flags*. The *first dose went fine*, the *second was really hard*, and she insisted on a *third*.

I felt uncomfortable. Erica said, “Do it.” I did.  
But I should’ve said no — the third experience *made things worse*.

**Lesson:** Trust your **intuition**.

### Balancing Potency and Relationship

**Jason Foster:**
Remember: the client is building a *relationship with you* and with *the medicine*.

That’s why I recommend starting lower — especially for the *first session*. But you also want the experience to be *meaningful*, so there’s a tension to manage.
