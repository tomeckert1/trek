### Booster Rationale and Precautions

**Jason Foster:**
- You can *always boost*.
- You *can’t subtract* once it’s ingested.
- Being cautious up front is smart.
- If the first dose isn’t enough, and you’ve both agreed on a *target intensity*, then you can *add a booster*.

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

**Jason Foster:**
Many of you probably have *stories* where:

> “It wasn’t working… so I took more… and then got way too high.”

Hands up? (Lots of hands go up.)

So don’t fall into that trap.

### Timing and Strategy for Boosting

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s talk about *when* to boost.
- The *initial dose* may take time to kick in.
- If you boost *too soon*, both doses might *stack*, and the client may get *higher than expected*.

*Best Practices:*
1. *Give time* for the initial dose to work.
2. Work with the client’s *resistance or stuckness* first.

### Recognizing Resistance

**Jason Foster:**
After *one hour*, most people should feel *something*.
- If they feel *nothing* or *very little*, ask:
  - “Is there a part of you resisting the experience?”
  - “What are you feeling right now?”

If they report fear, tightness, or anxiety:
- Invite them to do *deep breathing* for 10–15 minutes.
- Consider adding:
  - Aromatherapy
  - Weighted blankets
  - Soothing presence/language

If still nothing after 15 more minutes → consider a *booster*.
