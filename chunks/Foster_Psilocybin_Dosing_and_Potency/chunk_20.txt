### Colorado Differences

**Jason Foster:**  
Oh, and just to clarify — in *Colorado*, the rules are the *same*, except for *in-home use*.
- There, the *facilitator* is the one who handles the mushrooms.
- There are specific rules about:
  - *Transporting* them from the service center
  - *Storing* them
  - Ensuring they’re used compliantly

So the model is similar, but slightly more *facilitator-centric*.

That’s that!
