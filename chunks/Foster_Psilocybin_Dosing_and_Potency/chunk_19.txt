### Q&A – Service Center Practices

**Student:**
Do service centers have smoothie ingredients?

**Jason Foster:**
Good question — Lisa?

**Lisa:**
- We have *tea-making supplies*
- No *grinder* on-site — facilitators bring their own
- No *smoothie equipment* available

**Student:**
Can clients grind the mushrooms?

**Lisa:**
- Yes, clients must *grind* the mushrooms themselves
- Service center reps cannot alter the mushrooms directly

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah, it’s awkward, but only the client can *prepare* the mushrooms beyond opening the package. That includes blending and grinding.

**Lisa:**
And about chocolate — technically not in the rules, but we do offer tiny chocolate pieces at the service center. It's a *gray area* — it may *enhance* effects but isn't as strong an alteration as lemon tekking.

**Jason Foster:**
Bottom line:  
- Chocolate may *potentiate* the experience  
- Interpretations of the rule vary  
- Be aware of what enhances the experience, even subtly

### Service Center Compliance & Colorado Rules

**Jason Foster:**
As mentioned earlier, *service center representatives* — the so-called “mushroom fairies” — must:
- *Serve the mushrooms*
- Be *present* when the client *ingests* them
- Also be there for any *booster* doses

### More on Smoothies

**Student:**
If someone wants a smoothie, does the facilitator put the mushrooms in the blender?

**Jason Foster:**
Nope. You *can’t* do that.

**Student:**
Wait, so who puts the mushrooms in the blender?

**Jason Foster:**
Only the *client* can. Once the package is opened, it’s considered a *sale*, and then the client can prepare them.  
Yes, it's a bit *awkward*.

**Lisa:**
That includes *grinding* — clients must grind the mushrooms themselves.  
We can't do that for them.

### Chocolate Revisited

**Student:**
One more thing — chocolate. You said it's not allowed?

**Jason Foster:**
Technically, anything that *alters or enhances* the chemical structure is not allowed. That’s how the rule is worded.  
But…

**Lisa:**
…there’s some *interpretation*.  
We use tiny chocolate pieces in the service center — not to alter the medicine, but to help *wash it down*.

**Jason Foster:**
So yeah, *know* that if you give someone chocolate with their mushrooms, it will *enhance* the effects slightly.  
It’s good to be aware of that.
