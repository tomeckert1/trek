### A Map of the Psyche

**Jason Foster:**
I want to share a little map of the psyche that I like to refer to. Imagine a sphere:
- The center, the ground we're walking on in normal consciousness, represents everyday awareness.
- Beneath that is the underground—this is the personal unconscious. It's the body. It contains the shadow.
- Deeper still is the outer underground: the collective unconscious and archetypes.
- Above the sphere is the sky: pure consciousness, heavenly realms.

So bursting out the top of the bubble might look like psychosis—or maybe a really good trip.

Our wounded selves live underground. These parts have a kind of gravity—and we are pulled down. Something in us wants to be whole.

Ignoring that gravity can manifest as depression. Everything just feels heavy.

Trying to escape that gravity might look like floating upward: hanging out at the top of the sphere. That could be mania, addiction, overwork, religious crusades, grandiosity, or dissociation. You become ungrounded. Because the weight and darkness of what’s below feels like too much, you try to rise above it.

But approached consciously, that gravity can be heard as a call to the underworld journey.
