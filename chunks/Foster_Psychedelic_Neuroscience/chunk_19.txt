**Jason Foster:**
- *Self-acceptance and wholeness* come through the love of others.
- Healing takes:
  - Personal inner work
  - A *village* of supportive mirrors
  - Ongoing *integration*
  - Trusted people reflecting back your *authentic self*

> “It takes a village of people to welcome those parts of you that you thought were worthless or unacceptable.”
- *Psychedelics* can help us make contact with our “golden core”
- This supports the process of healing and reclaiming authenticity
