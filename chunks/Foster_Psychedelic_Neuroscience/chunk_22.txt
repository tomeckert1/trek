### Q&A Highlights

**student:**
Does dosing relate to how much the Default Mode Network (DMN) shuts down?

**Jason Foster:**
  - You don’t necessarily want the DMN to go fully offline.
  - A complete override may *bypass* meaningful work.
  - A loosened DMN allows for access and flow, which is *more productive* than obliteration.
  - The internal struggle (e.g., wrestling with the superego) can be *part of the healing*.
  - For most, *20–25mg* of psilocybin can facilitate productive tension and access.

**Tal Sharabi**
- Lower doses may allow for *titratable encounters* with trauma.
- Skimming the edges (e.g., “touch and go”) helps build confidence and emotional resilience.

### Ending Psilocybin Sessions

**Jason Foster:**
*OHA Rules for Minimum Session Time by Dosage*
- Timelines are *minimums*, not recommendations
- Assess *based on readiness*, not the clock

**Tal Sharabi**
*Signs Client is Returning:*
- Changes in *speech*
- Increased *eye contact* and *cognition*
- Movement, stretching, hunger
- Orienting to time and place

*Be Attuned:*
- Are they *struggling*?
- Are they trying to *keep you close*?
- Might be *full of awe*, *fear*, or *disorientation*

*Physical Needs:*
- Hydration
- Temperature
- Hunger
- Space to rest or reflect

*Managing Chatty or Silent Clients:*
- Chattiness might signal a need for *connection*
- Silence might reflect *processing*
- Encourage *continued inner reflection*
- “Don’t talk the magic away.”

### Final Tips:

**Tal Sharabi**
- Avoid processing too much at end of session—save for *integration*
- Offer *supportive phrases*:
  - “You did great work.”
  - “Thank you for letting me be part of your journey.”

- *Closing Rituals* may include:
  - Blowing out a candle
  - Reading a poem
  - Smudging (with consent)
  - Saying their name and “Come home”

- *Watch for urges* to leave too soon; gently encourage *curiosity*
- Remind them about *big life changes*—pause before major decisions
- If trauma memory surfaces, spend *more time* supporting them

### A Final Note from Tal:

**Tal Sharabi**
- After a client leaves, *energetically tend* to the space
  - Even if secular, take a moment to *look around*
  - Consider saying:  

    “I’m calling back all parts of myself. You’re calling back all parts of yourself.”
