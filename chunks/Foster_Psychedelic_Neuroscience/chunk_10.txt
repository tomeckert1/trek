### Trauma and Disconnection from Self

**Jason Foster:**
As Emma mentioned earlier, I love this quote from A.H. Almaas:
> *“The fundamental thing that happened is not that there was no love or support.  
> The greater calamity is that you lost connection to your essence.”*

Trauma is disconnection from self.  
And self comes from connection to the *body*, via the *insula*.

### Big T vs. Little t Trauma

**Jason Foster:**
You’ve probably heard these terms before:

*Big T Trauma:*
These are *obvious, overwhelming events*:
- Physical or sexual assault
- Natural disasters
- Severe accidents or medical emergencies
- Combat
- Sudden loss of a loved one

*Features:*
- Life-threatening or profoundly violating  
- Acute and time-bound  
- Activates hyperarousal or dissociation  
- PTSD symptoms: flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance  

**Jason Foster:**
*Little t Trauma:*

*Features:*
These are *chronic or subtle relational wounds*, often not seen as “trauma”:
- Repeated invalidation or emotional neglect
- Being shamed for needs, feelings, or identity
- Chronic misattunement from caregivers
- School or workplace humiliation
- Unstable home environments (even without overt violence)
- Often developmental or relational  
- Internalized as: “Something is wrong with me”  
- Doesn’t meet PTSD criteria  
- Shapes personality, emotional patterns, body tension  
- Can lead to *Complex PTSD*, *identity fragmentation*, *body armoring*

**student:**
Even things like job changes or moving houses can be ‘little t’ trauma if they disrupt someone’s sense of safety or pattern.  

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah—especially when repeated. That’s a good way to think about it. Enough ‘little t’ traumas can equal the impact of a big T trauma.
