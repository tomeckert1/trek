### Anatomy of Emotional Awareness

**Jason Foster:**
Healthy bottom-up functioning allows information to flow from the body into the *insula* and the *anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)*:

- *Insula*: Responsible for interoception (awareness of internal states), somatic processing, emotional experience, empathy, and social cognition.
    - Social cognition includes recognizing others’ emotions through facial and bodily cues.
    - *Reminder:* Empathy requires a connection to the body.  
      *“If empathy is a stretch, you're in your head.” — Cyr Barso*

- *Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)*: More top-down oriented.
    - Forms and stores schemas.
    - Maps context and events onto appropriate actions.
    - Responsible for *theory of mind*—the ability to understand mental states (beliefs, intentions, desires) in ourselves and others.

Schemas live in and are retrieved from the hippocampus. These form the architecture for interpreting relationships—ourselves in relation to others.
