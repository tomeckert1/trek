### Opening Framing

**Jason Foster:**
The title of my talk today is *Psychedelic Neuroscience, the Underworld Journey, and the Body*.

I just want to start by saying this is just one perspective. Hopefully, as you absorb the various perspectives from Emma, Tal, Erica, Simon—you’ll start to get a fuller picture of what's happening to people on psychedelics.

This talk, in particular, is psychologically oriented. I'm not going to get into transpersonal experiences here. I'm going to try to weave together several lenses: neurobiological, mythological and symbolic, and psychological.

I don't know if I've said this here before, but somebody once said to me: psychedelics take you to church, they take you to school, and they take you to the hospital.

Visiting the underworld—going down into the body to find our wounded parts, the personal unconscious—that’s going to the hospital.

Peter Gabriel's lyrics come to mind: *"Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt."*
