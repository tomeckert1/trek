### Working with Resistance

**Jason Foster:**
- *Protector parts* will arise when emotions are too intense
- May manifest as:
  - Distraction
  - Avoidance
  - Physical tension

Facilitators can:
- *Pause* when protectors come online
- Invite curiosity: “What’s it like to meet this part of you?”
- Describe it: vibration? heaviness? a wall?

Sometimes *just naming the resistance* helps it begin to shift.

### Core Energetics and Emotional Flow

**Jason Foster:**
- When *withheld negative energy* (rage, grief, fear) is expressed and released:
  - The system *clears*
  - *Essence* is restored
  - The *body and insula light up*
  - The *protector* can step back

> "We free the exiled inner child from his cage."

This results in:
- Reconnection to the body
- Metabolization of trauma
- Schema updates
- Protector behavior changes
