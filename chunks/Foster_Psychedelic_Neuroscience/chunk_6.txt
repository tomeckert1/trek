### Neuroscience and Psychedelics

**Jason Foster:**
You're probably all familiar with this: psilocybin gets converted to psilocin, which enters the brain and activates serotonin receptors. It acts as a serotonin agonist and increases cortical entropy.

That by itself doesn’t tell me much about what's happening experientially or psychologically.

Fortunately, Robin Carhart-Harris gave us the REBUS model: *Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics.*

### REBUS Model (Quick Review)

**Jason Foster:**
So just a quick review:
- Top-down predictions (priors), or what I’ll refer to as *schema*, are weakened.
- This allows *bottom-up* information to emerge.

### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Processing

**Jason Foster:**
*Top-down*:
- Helps us keep our shit together.
- Suppresses or contains energy from the body and impulses.
- Holds all the “shoulds” — e.g., “I should do this exercise,” “I should touch someone’s hand.”
- Includes schemas and priors.

*Bottom-up*:
- Comes from the body.
- It’s where our feelings, expression, intuition, and sense of self live.

A healthy balance between both is necessary for belonging and healthy social functioning. Think of it as a spectrum:
- Too much bottom-up → mania, taking up too much space, unaware of impact on others.
- Too much top-down → chameleon-like behavior, masking, nobody really gets to know you.

One question I like from Brené Brown is:

> *“How can I not puff up, not shrink back, but stand my sacred ground?”*

That feels like the sweet spot of a healthy middle.
