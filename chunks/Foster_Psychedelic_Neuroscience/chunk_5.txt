### Myth of Inanna (Part 1)

**Jason Foster:**
One of my favorite myths is the myth of Inanna. I share this with a lot of clients. Simon has a chapter on it in his book, and he goes into a lot more detail—highly recommended.

I’m just going to give you a very brief version.

This is the archetypal *heroine’s* journey. It’s a descent myth. That’s contrasted with the *hero’s* journey, which is more about expansion.

Here’s the beginning:

> Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, gets a call from her sister, Ereshkigal, Queen of the Underworld.  
> Inanna descends through seven gates. At each gate, she discards something—her crown, her scepter, her iPhone.  
> In her absence, the fields lie fallow, the birds stop singing. The Queen of Heaven is no longer blessing the earth.  
> When she gets to the underworld, Ereshkigal kills her and hangs her lifeless corpse on a meathook.

To be continued.
