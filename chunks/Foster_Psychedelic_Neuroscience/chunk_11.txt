### What Trauma Does to the Brain

*Trauma reduces activity in the insula*, leading to:
- Reduced *interoception*
- Diminished *emotional processing*
- Lower *empathy*
- Emotional detachment from self and others

> “Again, referencing Almaas: trauma is disconnection from self.”

### A Note on MDMA Trials

**Jason Foster:**
The *MAPS* studies on MDMA-assisted therapy:
- Primarily measure effects on *shock trauma* (Big T trauma)
- Even if participants have complex PTSD, only the shock trauma is evaluated

*Findings:*
- 2–3 MDMA sessions often resolve shock trauma  
- *CPTSD is much more difficult*—it requires *longer-term work*

> Similarly, *psilocybin* is unlikely to "fix" someone in one session.
> But it may *open a path* toward healing.
