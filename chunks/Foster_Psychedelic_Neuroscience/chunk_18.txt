### The Golden Buddha Parable

**Jason Foster:**
- A village conceals a golden Buddha with concrete to avoid an invading army
- Over time, the villagers forget the Buddha’s true nature
- A monk discovers the gold beneath the concrete
- The Buddha is unearthed, revealing its true form

*Metaphor:*
- We are all born golden
- Society layers us in "stone" (roles, rules, shame)
- A life event—injury, crisis, divorce—*cracks the armor*
- Once the gold is seen, the stone no longer satisfies
- We begin the journey of *excavation*

> “The moment you see the gold, the concrete will never satisfy you again.”
