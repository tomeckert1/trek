### DMN = Superego

**Jason Foster:**
In psychoanalytic terms, the *default mode network* is the *superego*:
- Internalizes societal and parental standards.
- Functions as a moral conscience.
- Necessary for social functioning—without it, we’d lack inhibition and empathy.

But it can become *rigid*—a *fascist superego*.

> I had a client who called her critical part “Little Hitler.”

This fascist superego forms when early attachment figures were unsafe. It censors our humanity to ensure survival.

Healthy emotional responses from the insula—like grief, anger, vulnerability—get shut down and stored away.

### Schema and Relationship Patterns

**Jason Foster:**
Schemas can drive interpersonal dynamics:

*Example:*
- My partner screams at me.
- I express healthy anger and set a boundary.
- She calls me an asshole and withdraws.
- I feel shame.
- My fascist superego says: “It’s not okay to advocate for yourself.”
- I suppress my anger to preserve connection.

> If this happens repeatedly, the result is *depression*.

In this story:
- Early schema: “If I advocate for myself, I’ll lose love.”
- So I stuff my feelings, lock them away, and lose vitality.

The cage and the fascist superego are not entirely distinct—they’re part of the same *system*.
