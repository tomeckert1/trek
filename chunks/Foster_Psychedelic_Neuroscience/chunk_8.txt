### Schema, Memory, and Projection

**Jason Foster:**
Relational memory—especially trauma and early life experience—can become active players in daily relationships.

Example:
- Someone sees a friendly smile, but their schema interprets it as a predator's grin.
- A blank stare might become a projection screen for a mother’s critical gaze.

This doesn’t begin with conscious thought. It begins with a schema being activated—and suddenly, you’re in fight, flight, or freeze.

You might not even know why: *“This person just scares me.”*

Schemas can be analyzed through therapy, but implicit memories—the raw, nervous-system-level experiences—can’t be shifted just by talking. You can tell someone “Not all men are abusive,” but if that’s their trauma, it won’t change their schema on a body level.

### Suppression, Shame, and the Default Mode Network

**Jason Foster:**
As our social learning system develops, we categorize what’s acceptable and unacceptable. The parts of us deemed "unacceptable" get locked away.
> One way to think about it:  
> The bars of the cage are made of *shame*.

Examples:
- “It’s not okay for me to cry.”
- “It’s not okay for me to get mad at Mother.”
- “I’m weak because I couldn’t stand up to my abusive father.”
- “I’m not supposed to have needs.”

These aspects of self—tears, anger, longing—come from the body, from the *insula*. But they don’t get expressed when the *default mode network (DMN)* shuts them down via the *anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)*.
