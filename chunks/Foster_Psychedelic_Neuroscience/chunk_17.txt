### The Myth of Inanna, Continued

**Jason Foster:**
When we last left Inanna:
- She was hanging lifeless on a meathook in the underworld

*In the next part of the myth:*
- Two humble beings (from under Enki’s fingernail) descend
- They *listen* empathetically to Erishkegal’s pain
- Arishkegal *thanks them* and asks how she can repay them
- They ask for Inanna’s body
- Arishkegal pours the *Water of Life* into Inanna’s mouth

**Jason Foster:**
*In the next part of the myth:*
- Inanna revives
- Flowers bloom, birds sing, fertility returns
- Inanna *embraces* Erishkegal and promises to visit more often

> We are *both* Inanna and Erishkegal. Wholeness means integrating the two.

The *Water of Life* symbolizes:
- Flow of emotion
- Vitality
- Reconnection

Could the water be:
- The mushrooms?
- A gentle, empathetic facilitator?
- The client’s inner healer?
