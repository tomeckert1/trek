### The Fascist Superego in Session

**Jason Foster:**
When suppressed material tries to emerge:
- The fascist superego may *fight harder*
- Old memories or critical voices may arise as internal obstacles

> “Don’t cry—Dad’s here and he’s angry.”
>  
> “Don’t you dare get angry—remember what happened last time.”

These *internalized commands* can flash through the experiential field and inhibit the healing process.

### Supporting the Healthy Voice

**Jason Foster:**
Sometimes, a *core voice* begins to speak:
- “It wasn’t my fault.”
- “Fuck them.”

This is the voice of the *inner child* or *core self* pushing back against suppression.

*Facilitator interventions:*
- Support and mirror that voice
- Invite the expression into *movement*
  - “What would your hands be doing if you said ‘fuck you’ to your dad?”

> Reminder: These images may be *projected onto the facilitator*.
