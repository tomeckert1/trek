### Sacredness and the Mystery of the Soul

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
One of the key themes in my earlier talk on Mazatec cosmology was sacredness. Many Indigenous cultures have preserved a living relationship to the sacred—a dimension that Western culture has largely lost touch with.

Of course, sacredness is itself a complex concept. Every culture approaches it differently, with its own deities, ritual practices, and mythopoetic frameworks. In contrast, Western culture has often replaced these mythologies with technological and scientific metaphors.

But sacredness does not belong to any one culture.

Each tradition—whether Indigenous or Western—creates its own metaphors, symbols, and rituals to connect with the mystery of the soul. When we in the West seek reconnection with this mystery, it’s natural to look to Indigenous cultures and feel drawn to their ceremonies, chants, and imagery.

Still, we must be careful.

### Cultural Appropriation and Creative Integrity

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
When we take rituals, symbols, or ceremonial practices from cultures we do not belong to, without permission or deep understanding, this can become cultural appropriation.

Instead, I propose a different approach: we can be inspired by Indigenous traditions, and we can appreciate the beauty and depth of their ways of relating to mystery. But then we should also turn inward and draw from our own creativity.

That’s how rituals and symbols are born—through the imagination and spiritual creativity of medicine people, shamans, and elders. And that same creative capacity lives within all of us as human beings.

So let us create our own rituals, symbols, and ways of connecting with the sacred—rooted in our own lived experience and culture—rather than imitating what belongs to others.
