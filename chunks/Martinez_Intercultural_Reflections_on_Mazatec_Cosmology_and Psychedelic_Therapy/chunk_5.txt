### From Inspiration to Innovation: Creating Our Own Ritual Forms

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Again, I want to emphasize: rather than reinforcing a binary between Western and Indigenous frameworks, let’s acknowledge the multicultural complexity of our reality.

As people newly arriving into the world of psychedelics—especially those of us shaped by Western culture—we now have the opportunity to co-create new forms of ritual and meaning. Yes, we can draw inspiration from Indigenous perspectives. But we must also connect with our own intuitive and creative intelligence.

### The Intercultural Therapy Paradigm

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
There is another valuable framework to bring into this discussion: the intercultural therapy paradigm.

In Mexico, there is a growing movement in this direction. I’ve been involved with an organization called *Nierika*, a nongovernmental association that works closely with Indigenous medicine people. Together, we engage in *dialogues of knowledge*—respectful exchanges that allow both traditional wisdom and modern psychology to be in conversation.

This collaborative approach has helped to design intercultural therapies that integrate elements of ritual—such as ceremonial structures, chants, and symbolic images—without appropriating the deeper cosmologies or sacred frameworks of those cultures.

Instead, we build something new: a complementary blend that incorporates sacredness *and* modern psychotherapeutic tools. These include guided exercises, psychological techniques, and contemporary containment strategies—all within a setting that honors the spiritual dimension of healing.

This is what we mean by an *intercultural container*—a space that makes room for sacredness without extraction, and that seeks ethical collaboration rather than imitation.

### Related Work and Voices

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
This movement is not happening only in Mexico. In the United States, *Chacruna Institute* is also advocating for Indigenous knowledge systems to be recognized and honored in how we understand healing and psychedelic experience.

Another important figure is *Francoise Bourzat*, who has worked closely with Mazatec *curanderas*. Inspired by their ways, she developed her own therapeutic model that integrates both Indigenous and Western frameworks, blending them to create a unique container.

Her book, *Consciousness Medicine*, explores this approach in depth. I recommend that you read it. I believe you will receive more information soon about how to access it through your program.

### Toward a Dialogue of Perspectives

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
To summarize:

We should move beyond framing Western and Indigenous systems as oppositional. Instead, we can adopt the concept of an *ecology of knowledge*—a vision proposed by Portuguese sociologist *Boaventura de Sousa Santos*—which values the coexistence and interconnection of multiple knowledge systems, just as we value biodiversity in nature.

Each culture has developed its own metaphors, rituals, and frameworks for relating to the mystery of life, the soul, and the sacred. We can appreciate and learn from Indigenous traditions, while also taking responsibility for creating our own culturally relevant and ethically grounded pathways.

Let us be inspired.

Let us be respectful.

And let us be creative—bringing forth new symbols, new rituals, and new ways of approaching the mystery, informed by the richness of many traditions but rooted in our own authenticity and context.

Thank you for listening. I hope these reflections spark further conversation and help deepen your understanding as facilitators and seekers. See you soon.
