### Introduction

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Hello, everyone. I am Mario Alonso Cordero Martinez again, and I am creating this video to continue the discussion regarding Mazatec cosmology and, more broadly, traditional Indigenous knowledge in conversation with the Western scientific perspective.

This is such a complex topic that I feel it deserves further exploration.

### Beyond Binary: Western vs. Indigenous Perspectives

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
The first thing I want to say is that I agree with my friend Simon: we should avoid framing this as a binary of Western versus Indigenous perspectives, with one placed above the other.

Instead, I propose we think in terms of different *ways of approaching knowledge*. A helpful concept for understanding this is the “ecology of knowledges,” a term proposed by Portuguese sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos. He suggests that just as we should preserve biodiversity in nature, we should also preserve a diversity of ways of knowing.

Yes, there is a dominant perspective today—the Western, scientific, materialistic worldview—which has shaped how psychedelic therapy is conducted and understood. It occupies the main stage. Meanwhile, Indigenous knowledge systems have often been sidelined or excluded.

But the answer is not to reject Western science entirely and turn only toward Indigenous perspectives. Rather, we must acknowledge the harm done by colonialism, including how it devalued Indigenous ways of knowing. That acknowledgment is a first step toward repair. From there, we can begin to understand these knowledge systems as complementary—much like the right and left hemispheres of the brain.
