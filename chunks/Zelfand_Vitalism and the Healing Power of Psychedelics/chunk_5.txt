### The Six Principles of Naturopathic Medicine

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Whether I’m working as a physician or simply holding space as a facilitator, these six principles guide me:

1. *First, do no harm.*  
   We’re here to be helpful and harmless to our clients.

2. *Identify and treat the causes.*  
   We work with the root causes, not just symptoms.

3. *Treat the whole person.*  
   We don’t say, “Mushrooms treat depression.” No — mushrooms help people, and some of those people have depression.

4. *Leverage the healing power of nature.*  
   This refers to both the person’s innate healing ability and the power of natural substances like psilocybin to support healing.

5. *Physician as teacher.*  
   Or in our case, facilitator as teacher. We do a lot of education and empowerment in our support role.

6. *Prevention.*  
   An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
