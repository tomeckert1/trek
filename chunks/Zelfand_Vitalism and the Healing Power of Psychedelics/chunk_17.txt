When *suppression persists*, *disease manifests*.

### Vital Force Always Works

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Even when suppressed:
- The *vital force* keeps trying to heal.
- It just finds *weird, distorted* outlets.
- Symptoms are not random; they are the *body’s attempt* to heal or express.

### Key Takeaway

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
> *Our role is not to suppress symptoms, but to support safe expression and discharge.*

We must be *comfortable with messy healing* — rage, tears, sweat, loudness — as it may be *exactly* what the client’s inner healer needs.
