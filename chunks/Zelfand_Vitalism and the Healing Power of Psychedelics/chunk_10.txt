### The Bucket Analogy: Understanding Toxicity and Healing

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s think about the body like a *bucket*.

Throughout life, our "bucket" fills up with *toxicity*:
- Infections
- Bad genes
- Pesticides
- Toxic foods
- Pharmaceuticals
- Trauma
- Stress

When the *bucket overflows*, that's when *illness*, *disease*, or even *death* occurs.

Fortunately, the body has *holes in the bucket* that let toxins drain out.

### Detox Pathways: Draining the Bucket

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
The body's "holes" — our *detox pathways* — include:
- *Pooping* (gastrointestinal)
- *Peeing* (urinary)
- *Menstruation* and *ejaculation* (reproductive)
- *Breathing* (lungs)
- *Sweating* (skin)
- *Emotional release* (crying, anger, journaling, expression)

*Emotions* are a major detox pathway!  
If emotions are suppressed, it's like plugging up one of the most vital holes.

Many people suffer from what I call "*emotional constipation*," and psychedelics can act like a "*psychic enema*" — unplugging that emotional blockage.

### Strategy for Health: Two Key Goals

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
1. *Reduce toxicity coming into the bucket.*
2. *Make sure the holes stay open and functioning.*

If we do that, we prevent overflow — we support health.

This reorients how we think about illness and healing interventions.
