### "Use All the Tools"

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
One of my mottos: *Use all the tools.*

Sometimes psychedelics can *support*, but so can:
- Therapy
- Lifestyle changes
- Nutrition
- Community support

Example:  
There’s sometimes judgment in the psychedelic world against things like *AA* or *NA* (Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous).  
I once told a client: *If you think NA could help you, use it. Use all the tools.*

Our biases shouldn’t limit our clients.

It’s about empowering clients to:
- Access what they feel drawn to
- Use whatever supports their healing
- Trust their own inner compass
