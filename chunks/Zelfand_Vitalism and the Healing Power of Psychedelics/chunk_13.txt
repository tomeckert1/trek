### Suppression vs. Discharge: Understanding Pathology

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**  
Let's talk about *suppression* — the act of *pushing down* or *stopping* something forcibly.

When someone *suppresses* their emotions, their body's *vital force* doesn’t stop working — it just gets *redirected*, often in distorted or pathological ways.

### Real-Life Case Study: The Man with the Invisible Rash

*Patient Profile:*
- 40s, married (second marriage)
- Financially supporting two households
- Good-paying job he hated
- Walked along a disgusting highway to work daily
- Gave up hobbies he loved (boating, golf, skiing)
- Described life as "service" — supporting his family
- At night, only allowed to use the iPad if he returned it downstairs

*Presenting Symptom:*
An intense, invisible rash — unbearably itchy, but no physical manifestation.

Doctors couldn’t explain it.

*What was happening?*

> *He wanted to claw his skin off because he hated his life.*

He was suppressing his soul, passions, and authentic self.  

The body found an outlet — *the skin* — but the true pathology was deeper.
