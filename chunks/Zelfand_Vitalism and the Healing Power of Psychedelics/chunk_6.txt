### What Is the Vital Force?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let's talk about the vital force.

Imagine you step on a nail and go to the doctor saying, “Heal me.”  
What does the doctor do?
- They pull the nail out.
- They check if it’s rusty — ask about your last tetanus booster.
- They clean the wound and monitor for infection.

But who actually *heals* the hole in your foot?  

Not the doctor. Not the antibiotic ointment.  
*Your body heals itself.*

How does it know how to do that?  
That's the vital force.

The vital force works on us physically and psychospiritually. Different cultures and healing systems have different names for it:
- In plants: *Viriditas* (lush vitality)
- In humans: *Vitality*, *vigor*, *energy*
- In naturopathic philosophy: *Vis medicatrix naturae* ("the healing power of nature")
- In psychedelic circles (Stan Grof’s work): *Inner healing intelligence*
- In Homeopathy: *Vital force*
- In Chinese Medicine: *Qi (Chi)*
- In Ayurveda: *Prana*

This concept goes back to Aristotle. He believed living organisms are fundamentally different from nonliving things — governed by different principles.

Our job as facilitators is to *work with* that healing force — to help our clients *align with* their own inner healing intelligence and *clear the obstacles* that are preventing it from doing its job.

### Facilitators and the Vital Force
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
If you’re not a clinician, people aren’t going to be coming to you with literal nails in their feet. But the literal examples help build the metaphor for understanding healing at deeper layers.

When we *remove an obstacle to healing*, like removing a nail, what we’re doing is:
- Clearing the path for the vital force to do its job
- Creating optimal conditions for healing

For example:
- Applying an antibiotic salve
- Giving a tetanus shot
- Advising rest without over-suppressing natural responses

As facilitators, we do the same thing metaphorically:
- We create *safe spaces*
- We foster *supportive set and setting*
- We offer a *caring, nonjudgmental, nonthreatening presence*

This allows the client's own healing force to work with the medicine and do its thing.

If we continue using a *vitalist approach*, we’ll not only understand the work better — we'll also get better results.

This is very different from the *default biomedical model*, which focuses heavily on *symptom suppression* rather than healing.
