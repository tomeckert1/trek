### My Training and Orientation

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Just briefly about me: I'm a naturopathic physician. The word "naturopath" can mean different things, but "naturopathic physician" or "naturopathic doctor" means someone who attended a four-year accredited medical program and trained in primary care.

Residency requirements vary; I did a residency in family medicine.

My scope of practice varies by state. In Oregon, where I'm licensed (although right now I'm in Mexico), naturopathic physicians can:
- Practice primary care
- Prescribe medications (including ketamine)
- Hold a DEA license
- Do nearly everything an MD PCP can do — except make a fair living through insurance billing

We’re trained in both conventional medicine and complementary and alternative medicine. You might have heard of "functional medicine" — that’s basically a sexed-up, rebranded, and more expensive version of complementary and alternative medicine.

In addition to the Hippocratic Oath, naturopathic doctors are guided by:
- Six core principles
- A philosophy called *vitalism*

I believe vitalism will serve you very well as psilocybin facilitators.
