### Example: Salmonella and the Vital Force

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Imagine someone gets *salmonella* food poisoning.

The body’s vital force kicks in:
- *Fever* raises body temperature to kill bacteria
- *Vomiting* expels pathogens
- *Diarrhea* flushes remaining toxins
- *Sweating* cools the body

This is a *brilliant, elegant response* orchestrated by the vital force.

But what happens when we suppress the symptoms?
- *Take ibuprofen* → suppress the fever.
- *Take Imodium* → suppress vomiting and diarrhea.

Result:  
We work *against* the body’s healing efforts.

### Healing Is Messy

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Healing is often *messy* and *inconvenient*:
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Crying
- Sweating
- Anger
- Rage
- Loud emotional expressions

*Our job as facilitators is to be okay with the mess.*

If you stay calm when healing gets messy, you allow the client’s process to unfold naturally.
