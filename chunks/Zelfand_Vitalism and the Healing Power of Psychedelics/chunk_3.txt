### Case Study Introduction: "Michelle"

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
I'd like to start with a case. (Excuse me one second — I need to minimize my screen. Did this last time too. Ah, much better.)

Let's talk about a woman — and this is a mashup of two cases to protect privacy — we'll call her Michelle. (That's not her real name, and the photo is a stock photo.)

Michelle was seeking to become pregnant, but she couldn’t do so until she got off some prescription medications first. She came to see me initially as a patient in my general medical practice — not yet for psilocybin work. We eventually ended up doing psilocybin work together.

Here’s what was going on with Michelle:
- Two miscarriages in her early thirties
- Since then, unable to become pregnant; considering IVF
- After her last miscarriage: significant weight gain, depression, constipation (taking MiraLAX daily), and taking escitalopram (an SSRI)
- TMJ (jaw clenching and grinding), treated with Botox injections (not allowed during pregnancy)
- Insomnia treated with zolpidem (Ambien) — again, not allowed during pregnancy
- Anxiety treated with alprazolam (Xanax), as needed

There were a lot of medications here, many incompatible with pregnancy. We'll revisit Michelle's case throughout the talk to explore how layers of symptoms can actually be expressions of a single underlying imbalance — and how thinking of the person as a unified system helps us understand the healing potential of psychedelics.
