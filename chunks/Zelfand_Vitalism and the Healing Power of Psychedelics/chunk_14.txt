### The Nature of Suppression

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
When we *suppress* emotions:
- They *don’t disappear*.
- They *go deeper* into the system.
- They create *deeper pathology* over time.

> *"Suppression is like clipping the wire to the 'Check Engine' light in your car, rather than fixing the engine."*

The symptom (rash, depression, insomnia) is the *warning light*.  
The real issue lies *under the hood*.

### When Suppression Is Necessary

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
There are moments when *suppression* is appropriate:

- *Asthma attacks* → Inhalers save lives
- *Full-body allergic reactions* → Steroids
- *Brain swelling* → Emergency hospital management
- *Acute suicidality* → Immediate intervention

But in most cases, chronic suppression *causes deeper issues*.
