### The Role of Inflammation: A Vital Example

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s use inflammation as another metaphor.

Inflammation actually serves a vital role:
- Makes blood vessels leaky so repair cells can access damaged tissues
- Helps fight infections
- Causes pain and swelling, which makes us rest the area and heal faster

Inflammation is *the vital force at work*.

But how does Western medicine treat acute inflammation?
- *Suppress it* — with ibuprofen, for example.
- Follow *RICE*: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.

*However:*
Modern research shows RICE can actually *prolong healing time*!  
Suppressing inflammation delays the natural repair process.

The *naturopathic approach* is different:
- *Allow inflammation to work productively*  
  - Use ice no more than 20 minutes at a time (soothe, not suppress)
  - Allow gentle movement (supports circulation)
  - Stabilize with a brace (prevent reinjury but encourage mobility)
  - Supplement with trace minerals, collagen, and nutrients

We *join* the body’s healing response — we *don’t suppress it*.

The same applies in psychedelic facilitation:  
We support and create conditions for healing, instead of rushing to suppress or control what's coming up.
