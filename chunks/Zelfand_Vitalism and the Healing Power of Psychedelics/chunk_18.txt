### The REBUS Model: Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**  
Let's talk about *REBUS* — *Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics* — a major theory by Carl Friston and Robin Carhart-Harris.

Under normal conditions, the brain:

- Develops *formulas* based on *past experiences*.
- Prefers *confirmation* of these beliefs.
- *Rejects* or *explains away* new information that challenges existing beliefs.

*Examples:*
- "Mom equals love."  
- "Mom equals rejection."  
- "I am inherently flawed."

Once these beliefs form, the brain becomes *rigid*, even if the beliefs are *hurtful*.

### What Psychedelics Do

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Examples:*
- Psychedelics *relax* rigid belief systems.
- They allow *new information* and *feelings* to be considered.
- People can *update* their understanding of themselves and the world.

> *Psychedelics literally help people open to the possibility that they are lovable, that healing is possible, and that reality can be different.*
