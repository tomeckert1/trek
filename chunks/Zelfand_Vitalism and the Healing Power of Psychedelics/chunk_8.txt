### Identifying and Treating the Cause

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Another core principle: *Identify and treat the cause.*

As facilitators, we’re not diagnosing illnesses, but it helps to think about this:

For example, when people say, "*Psilocybin treats depression*," what does that even mean?

*Depression* is just a label.  
It tells us *nothing* about what caused it.

Possible causes of depression include:
- Chronic *neuroinflammation*
- *Neurotransmitter imbalances*
- *Hormonal imbalances* (perimenopause, menopause, low testosterone)
- Difficult *life circumstances*
- *Nutritional deficiencies*

Each of these has very different roots.

Understanding the layers helps us:
- Support clients better
- Manage expectations
- Collaborate with other care providers when appropriate

### Chronic Neuroinflammation: Digging Deeper

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
When inflammation becomes *chronic*, especially in the nervous system, it causes big problems — including depression.

Chronic neuroinflammation can result from:
- Stealth infections (e.g., mold toxicity, root canal infections, parasites, long-haul COVID)
- Imbalances in gut microbiome (good vs. bad bacteria)
- Environmental exposures (heavy metals, radiation)
- Poor sleep
- Chronic stress
- Ancestral or collective trauma

If we don't understand what’s fueling the inflammation, we won’t really understand what the person needs for healing.

Psilocybin *can help* address:
- Stealth infections (sometimes)
- Psychological stress
- Denial about lifestyle choices

*But* if a client has poor gut health from eating ultra-processed food, psilocybin alone isn’t going to magically fix that.
