### Supporting the Vital Force

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
To support the client’s vital force, we:
- Create a safe, nonjudgmental container
- Encourage emotional expression
- Avoid rushing to "fix" or "stop" the process
- Normalize what’s happening ("This is healthy. This is normal.")

### Key Takeaway

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
> *Healing is often uncomfortable and messy.*  
> *Suppression blocks healing.*  
> *Expression and safe discharge support it.*

When we understand the body's natural healing intelligence, we can *trust the process* — even when it looks chaotic.
