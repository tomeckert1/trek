### Healing Crisis: When Things Get Worse Before They Get Better
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Sometimes, after a psilocybin session, people experience what's called a *healing crisis*.

It may look like:
- *Old symptoms* resurfacing (e.g., body aches, bellyaches, rashes).
- *Emotional turbulence* (e.g., bursts of anger, grief, shame).
- *Temporary worsening* of existing conditions.

*Important to Know:*
- A healing crisis usually lasts *a few days*.
- If symptoms persist longer than a week, or are severe, seek *medical evaluation*.
- Trust that the body is *revisiting old wounds* to heal them properly.

> *A bad response is not necessarily a bad sign. It could be deep healing underway.*

### Physical Healing Crisis Example

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
**Case Study:**
- *53-year-old woman* with *Stage IV colorectal cancer*.
- Did a psilocybin session to address *anxiety*.
- Developed a *rash* over chest and abdomen days later.
- History revealed *childhood sexual trauma* (rape at age 14).
- Rash coincided with *emotional release* about the trauma.

**Key Learning:**
- The physical rash was not just a side effect — it was a *manifestation of emotional detox*.
- Psilocybin helped *unearth unresolved trauma*, facilitating deeper healing.

### Handling Healing Crises as Facilitators

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- Stay *calm* and *compassionate*.
- *Normalize* the experience: "This may be your body completing an old cycle."
- *Refer* for medical care if needed.
- *Support integration*: help clients understand the meaning behind their symptoms.

When unsure about physical symptoms:
- *Err on the side of caution.*
- Encourage clients to get medical attention.

### Healing the Whole Person: Michelle’s Story

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let's revisit Michelle, the woman we met at the beginning of this talk.

*Michelle’s Symptoms*
- Multiple *miscarriages*: "I couldn't hold them."
- *Weight gain* and *depression* after miscarriages.
- *Constipation*, needing MiraLAX daily.
- *TMJ* (jaw clenching) treated with Botox.
- *Insomnia* and *anxiety*, treated with medications.

*The Underlying Pattern*

Each symptom reflected a *core message* Michelle internalized:

> *"You must hold it together."*
- Hold onto the pregnancy.
- Hold onto weight.
- Hold in waste (constipation).
- Hold tension (TMJ).
- Hold vigilance (insomnia and anxiety).

Her body kept *holding* tighter and tighter.

*Medications*, like MiraLAX and Botox, *artificially suppressed* the symptoms, but never addressed the deeper imbalance.

*Psilocybin Session*

- Michelle spent hours in the bathroom during her session.
- Crying, *peeing intermittently*, passing gas.
- A slow, gradual *release* from her pelvic floor and nervous system.
- She was afraid to leave the toilet because she didn’t trust her body yet — and we held space for that.

This process allowed her body to *unlearn the pattern of "holding."*

*Post-Session Healing*
- Gradually tapered off her medications.
- TMJ symptoms resolved without Botox.
- Constipation and insomnia lifted.
- Emotional healing progressed.

*Result:*
Within two years, Michelle was celebrating her healthy baby's *first birthday*.

### Lessons from Michelle’s Case

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Symptoms* were not separate — they were *expressions of a single underlying imbalance*.
- *Psilocybin didn't "treat" infertility, depression, or TMJ* individually.
- It *addressed the soul wound* that was distorting her entire system.

> Healing happens when we *treat the person, not the diagnosis.*
