### Introduction

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Thank you. Yeah, we're old friends at this point. So, welcome, everybody. Thanks for having me.

What I'd like to focus on today is proposing a medical philosophy that has room for psychedelic healing. I understand that most of you are not licensed clinicians or healthcare providers. That’s okay.

The reason I want to talk about this is because, in our default Western biomedical culture, part of why psychedelics are misunderstood — even villainized — is that we don't really have a good framework for understanding how they work and why they work.

In our current medical model, which is very mechanistic and seeks to isolate the parts, we lose the elegance and potency of this medicine.

So, I'd like to propose a different framework. I want to say "new," but it's actually a very old philosophy of medicine. I didn’t come up with this. I'm a naturopathic physician, and this is what I was taught in medical school.

When I got into the world of psychedelics, it was completely seamless. It wasn’t even a transition — it just made sense. Of course this is healing, and this is how healing works. I've seen some of my colleagues stumble a little more without this perspective.
