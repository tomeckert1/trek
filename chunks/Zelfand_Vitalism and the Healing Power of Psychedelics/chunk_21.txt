### The Healing Onion: Layers of Healing

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**  
Healing often happens in *layers*, much like *peeling an onion*.

Each symptom or emotional response we see might not be the *root issue*, but a *surface layer*.

> *What’s coming up now is coming up now because it’s ready to be healed now.*

### The Layers Example

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Core Wound:*
- Childhood *neglect*.

*Secondary Reactions:*
- *Anger* from unmet needs.
- Expressing anger led to *punishment* (abuse).
- *Suppression* of anger for survival.

*Tertiary Symptoms:*
- *Constipation* (body's way of holding in).
- *Depersonalization* (disconnecting from feelings).

*Adult Presentation:*
- Awkward social skills.
- Depression or unexplained physical symptoms.

### Healing Is Nonlinear
- Clients often don't heal in the order they (or we) expect.
- Symptoms *reappear* or *intensify* as part of the *healing process*.

*Adult Presentation:*
- Trust the *inner healing intelligence*.

> *Healing in layers requires patience, surrender, and grace.*

### Setting Client Expectations

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- Explain that healing is often *nonlinear*.
- Help clients understand that *unexpected content* may arise.
- Frame experiences (e.g., "feeling like a four-year-old") as *natural steps* in healing.

### Practical Integration Language

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- "This is coming up now because it is ready to be healed now."
- "Your inner healing intelligence is guiding this process."
- "Let's trust what is emerging."
