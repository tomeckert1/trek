### Transpersonal and Mystical Experiences

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Question: Does REBUS explain transpersonal experiences?*

**Elyse:**
Yes. Transpersonal experiences—like those from breathwork, drumming, or deep meditation—can lead to *limbic and emotional processing* similar to psychedelics.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s define “transpersonal experience”:
> Experiences that go beyond personal ego identity and connect one to a larger whole—nature, the divine, or universal consciousness.

Examples:
- Breathwork
- Shamanic drumming
- Meditation
- Spontaneous mystical states

> “Same-same but different road.”  
> And yes, these states are *strongly predictive of positive therapeutic outcomes.*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Mystical Experience Defined*

A mystical experience may involve:
- Ego softening or dissolution
- Unity with all things
- Sacredness or reverence
- Transcendence of time and space
- Ineffability (hard to put into words)
- Deep joy or peace

These are often described as:
> “One of the most meaningful experiences of my life.”

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ)*

Used in research to quantify mystical experiences. Developed by Walter Pahnke, revised in 2012. Measures four domains:
1. Mystical (e.g. sense of unity, sacredness)
2. Positive mood
3. Transcendence of time/space
4. Ineffability

Example questions:
- “Did you experience the fusion of your personal self into a larger whole?”
- “Did you sense the presence of something sacred?”
- “Did you feel an overwhelming sense of awe?”
