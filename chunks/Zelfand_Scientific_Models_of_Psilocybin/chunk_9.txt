### Serotonin and 5-HT2A Receptor Agonism

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s start with some history. Albert Hofmann, working at Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland, synthesized LSD and later investigated mushrooms from Mexico, helping to isolate *psilocybin* and *psilocin*.

*Structural Similarity to Serotonin*

Look at their chemical structure—psilocybin and psilocin are nearly identical to *serotonin* (5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine), which:
- Is a key neurotransmitter in mood, cognition, memory, sleep, appetite, and more
- Affects over *40 million* cells in the body
- Exerts its effects at the *synapse*—the space between neurons

*Receptor Binding*
- Psilocybin is a *serotonin agonist*—it binds to the same receptors as serotonin, especially *5-HT2A*.
- Binding to 5-HT2A is strongly associated with the psychedelic experience.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- If you block this receptor with a drug like *ketanserin*, then take psilocybin—you won’t trip.

> LSD lasts so long because it binds *very strongly and persistently* to the 5-HT2A receptor.

*Where Are These Receptors?*
- *Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)*:  
  This is part of the *Default Mode Network (DMN)*. It helps with internal focus, daydreaming, memory recall, cognition, and perception.
- *Visual Cortex*:  
- *Primary Motor Cortex*:  
  Has few 5-HT2A receptors. This is why psilocybin usually doesn’t impair coordination like alcohol does. But still—do not drive.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*5-HT1A vs. 5-HT2A Comparison*

Let’s compare two important serotonin receptors.

*5-HT1A*
- Supported by: SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)
- Located in: Limbic system (stress circuitry)
- *Effects*: 
  - Coping
  - Emotional blunting
  - Patience
  - Resilience
- *Analogy*: It’s like adding shocks to your car. The bumps are still there, but you don’t feel them as much.

*5-HT2A*
- *Activated by*: Psilocybin and other classic psychedelics
- *Located in*: Multiple cortical regions
- *Effects*: 
  - Learning and unlearning
  - Pattern breaking
  - New perspectives
- *Analogy*: You realize you can take the freeway instead of a bumpy road. You change the route altogether.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Peripheral Effects*

5-HT2A receptors also exist *outside* the central nervous system—in the:
- *Endocrine system* (thyroid, pancreas, adrenal glands)
- *Cardiovascular system*
- *Gut*
- *Skin*
- *Blood vessels*

> This is probably why psilocybin can cause nausea in some people—due to 5-HT2A activity in the gut.
