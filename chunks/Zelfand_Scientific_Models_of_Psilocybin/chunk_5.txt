### Psilocybin and Related Drug Classes

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
So, where are we in the world of psychedelic drugs? There are a few different drug classes, and psilocybin falls into the class known as the *tryptamines*.

- *Tryptamines*: Psilocybin and DMT (dimethyltryptamine) fall into this class. These substances primarily work by agonizing certain serotonin receptors. We’ll go into those details in a moment.

- *Ergolines*: We touched on this last time when we discussed ergot—that black fungus that grows on rye. It can stop postpartum hemorrhage or, depending on the dose, turn your fingers purple or make you hallucinate. LSD and its analogs fall into this class.

- *Phenethylamines*: This includes mescaline and the 2C family. These are stimulants with chemical structures similar to amphetamines.
> People don't like it when I say this, but I’m going to say it:  
> The “A” in MDMA stands for amphetamine. MDMA is an amphetamine.  
> That doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a place in healing.

These substances—called *empathogens* or *entactogens*—help us feel more connected: to others, to nature, to a sense of communion. And some of them are also hallucinogenic.
