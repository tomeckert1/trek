### The Default Mode Network & The Entropic Brain

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
This next theory, largely developed by *Robin Carhart-Harris*, is foundational to our modern understanding of psychedelic therapy.

The *Default Mode Network (DMN)* is a set of brain structures that arenâ€™t physically connected but operate together. It:
- Is active during *internal dialogue*, daydreaming, and *self-referential thinking*
- Helps organize reality through *predictive coding*
- *Minimizes uncertainty* by applying learned rules

*The Problem with Too Much Order*

When the DMN becomes overactive, it creates *rigidity* in thought and behavior.

> Conditions associated with overactive DMN include:
> - Depression
> - Anxiety
> - OCD
> - Addictions
> - Eating disorders

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
On the flip side, *too much entropy* (disorder/chaos) is also harmful:
- *Psychosis*
- *Seizures*
- *Mania*
