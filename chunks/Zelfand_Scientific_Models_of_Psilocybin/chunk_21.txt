### Awe and Personality Change

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Awe vs. Ego Death*
Study:
414 participants who had taken serotonergic psychedelics were surveyed about their experiences and completed various assessments.

*Key Finding:*
- *Ego death* did *not* correlate with decreased narcissism.
- *Awe*, however, *did* correlate with:
  - Less entitlement and exploitation
  - Increased empathy
  - Greater connection to humanity and nature

*Key Finding:*
> “Had a few ego deaths myself. Could use a few more. Still have a pretty strong ego. But the awe might be where it’s really at.”
