### What Is Psilocybin?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Psilocybin is a naturally occurring compound found in over 200 species of mushrooms and truffles. Psilocybin-containing species have been identified on every continent except Antarctica. The most common genus is *Psilocybe*.

*Psilocybin vs. Psilocin*
- *Psilocybin* is a *prodrug*, meaning it is inactive until the body metabolizes it.
- It gets converted into *psilocin*, the bioactive form that actually produces psychedelic effects.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
This conversion process is surprisingly complex and not entirely agreed upon in the literature. It involves several parts of the digestive system:

1. *Mouth & Stomach*:
   - You chew and swallow the mushroom.
   - Stomach acid breaks down the cellulose and liberates psilocybin.
   - Some sources suggest that conversion to psilocin begins here.

2. *Small Intestine*:
   - Enzymes called *alkaline phosphatases* convert more psilocybin to psilocin.

3. *Liver*:
   - Also rich in alkaline phosphatase enzymes.
   - Completes the conversion process.
   - Psilocin then enters systemic circulation and travels to the brain.

Psilocin is *lipophilic*, meaning it loves fat—and our brains are made mostly of fat. It crosses into the brain and binds to serotonin receptors, especially *5-HT2A*.
