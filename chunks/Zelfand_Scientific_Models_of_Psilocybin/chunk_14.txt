*Psychedelics = Temporary Visit to High Entropy*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Psychedelics *increase entropy* temporarily:
- They shake the “snow globe” of the mind
- This *disorganizes* rigid patterns
- But they *must be used with care*—too much chaos can destabilize vulnerable clients

> “Visit high entropy, learn from it, then return with insight.”
