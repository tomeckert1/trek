Some individuals have highly active default mode networks due to past trauma. When life feels unpredictable or unsafe, the brain may try to impose *rigid order* to feel safe. This often includes pushing painful memories into “dark corners.” Psychedelics can loosen this system, allowing *long-repressed memories* to resurface, which is part of the REBUS process.

Yes—and this can include things we really want but haven’t allowed ourselves to want, or deep fears we’ve hidden. Sometimes people interpret these as *prophecies* from the mushroom.
