### Neural Crosstalk: The Super Brain

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
One fascinating theory on how psilocybin works is through increasing *neural crosstalk*.

This concept is beautifully illustrated in a 2014 study that used brain imaging to compare normal brain activity with brain activity under psilocybin. What we see is:
- Under normal waking consciousness:  
  Communication happens mostly within established networks.
- Under psilocybin:  

  There are significantly *more lines of communication*, and—critically—*between regions that don’t normally talk to each other*.

*Why It Matters*

This increase in connectivity gives rise to:
- *Synesthesia*: Senses getting crossed. For example, someone's voice might “sound purple,” or numbers might have colors.
- *Novel insights* and connections
- *Creativity and innovation*
- *Breakthroughs in therapy*
- *Unusual or dreamlike phenomena*

> “When you take psilocybin, your brain becomes a super brain for 4–8 hours. Use that time wisely.”

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*The Temporary Nature*

Unfortunately, these new networks *do not last* beyond the duration of the drug’s action.
- You get a super brain for a short window.
- When it fades, the expanded networks fade too.
- But you can *retain the benefit* through *integration practices*.

*The Yoga Analogy*

While doing yoga on psychedelics, I realized something:

Let’s say you’re in Warrior I pose and the instructor keeps telling you to stack your trunk over your hips. You think you are—but you’re slightly leaning forward.

Then the instructor gently corrects you. You feel the difference.
- If you go to class again soon, you *remember* what it feels like and can re-create it.
- If you wait two years before doing yoga again, you forget.

> Psychedelic experiences are like that yoga class. If you don’t *integrate*, you forget. If you *practice*, you retain.
