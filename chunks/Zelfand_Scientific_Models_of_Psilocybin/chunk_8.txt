### How Psilocybin Works: Theories and Mechanisms

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s talk about how this drug actually works. Why are they called *magic* mushrooms—and how does the magic happen?

> A reminder: what I’m sharing here are *theories*. We are still learning.

Every time I give this talk, I have to go back into the literature and update it. And I give this talk every six months. That’s how fast the research is evolving.

We'll focus on several key mechanisms:
1. *Serotonin and 5-HT2A receptor agonism*
2. *Neural crosstalk (expanded connectivity)*
3. *Default Mode Network and the Entropic Brain*
4. *The REBUS Model: Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics*
5. *Mystical Experiences and Awe*
6. *Neuroplasticity*
