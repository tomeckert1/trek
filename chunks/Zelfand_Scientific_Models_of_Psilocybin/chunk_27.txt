### Closing Notes

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Zofran (ondansetron)* — used to prevent nausea:
  - Conflicting data on safety with psilocybin.
  - Anecdote: A graduate reported a client experiencing *akathisia* (tingling/pain throughout body for weeks) after taking Zofran before a psilocybin session.
  - *Conclusion:* Use with caution. There’s a *lack of clear data*.
