### Rebus: Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Another compelling theory is *REBUS*, which stands for:
> *Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics*

Developed by Robin Carhart-Harris and Karl Friston, this theory explores how psychedelics loosen the *top-down control* of the *default mode network*, allowing *bottom-up information* (sensations, memories, emotions) to surface.

*The Brain Loves Predictable Rules*

As we age, we form models about the world based on patterns and consistency:
- A + B = C
- People will always hurt me
- I’m not worthy of love
- Everything is connected
- I should never cry

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Even if these beliefs are faulty, they bring *psychological safety*.

When contradictory data arises, the brain tends to:
- Dismiss it
- Label it an “outlier”
- Explain it away

This is the *predictive coding* of the DMN at work.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*The Problem*

Clients often know their beliefs are harmful, but they still feel true:

> “I know people don’t always hurt me, but I still believe it.”

These rigid beliefs are *resistant to change*, especially if:
- Rooted in childhood trauma
- Reinforced over decades

*What REBUS Does*

Psychedelics disrupt top-down rigidity and allow *new information* to be taken seriously:
- Emotional memories
- Repressed experiences
- Forgotten truths
- Hidden desires

Instead of filtering these out, the brain says:
> “Oh, maybe that’s real too.”

This allows a *restructuring* of beliefs.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Real-Life Example: Vivek*

- Belief before trip:  
  > “I’m a burnt cookie. I was made wrong. I should be thrown away.”
- What he re-experienced during psilocybin session:  
  Childhood memories of being *loved* and *supported* by his grandmother and teacher.
- Belief after trip:  
  > “I’m a delicious cookie. I was made just right.”

That is REBUS in action.

*Important Note*

REBUS doesn’t just bring up trauma—it can also surface:
- Longings and desires you didn’t know you had
- Fears you’ve hidden from
- Repressed joy

> “Sometimes people think the mushrooms are giving them a prophecy—when really, they’re just showing what they’ve longed for or feared.”
