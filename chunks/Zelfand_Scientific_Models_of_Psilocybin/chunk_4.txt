### Session Logistics and Overview

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Perfect. And just a fair warning—there is a quiz on this material in Moodle. So pay attention! But you’ll also have access to the slides later.

Here's what we’ll be covering tonight:
1. Introduction to the drug class psilocybin belongs to.
2. Theories on how psilocybin works (and these are still theories—we’re learning fast).
3. Key studies to help us understand its mechanisms and effects.
4. High-risk populations and considerations when working with psilocybin.

This is an introductory talk. I have another presentation coming up that goes deeper into drug interactions, medical emergencies, and more. You’ll see this material again.
