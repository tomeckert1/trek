### Introduction

**Elyse Raupp-Gardner:**
I’m going to introduce Dr. Erica Zelfand. I know you’ve already met her a couple of times, but I’ll just go ahead and introduce her again.

Dr. Erica Zelfand—one of InnerTrek’s distinguished educators—is a licensed family doctor, ketamine provider, and psychedelic facilitator. She specializes in functional medicine and integrative mental health, and she’s well-versed in pharmaceutical, nutritional, botanical, somatic, and psychedelic approaches to healing.

She’s written extensively on psychedelics, offers seminars and courses for professionals, and regularly presents at conferences and medical school grand rounds. Erica has also served as medical supervisor for the Zendo Project, supporting psychedelic safety and harm reduction. She’s currently the executive director of Right to Heal.

Erica’s going to be presenting on scientific mechanisms of action and effects in specific client populations, which is basically a really fun version of neuroscientific psychedelic research. I would never want to learn this stuff from anyone but you, Erica.

Quick fun story— the reason I got into psychedelic work is because I watched Erica present on this very topic at a continuing education course for professionals in Oregon, maybe six or seven years ago. I’m excited to go deeper with you tonight. I'll hand the mic over to you.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Thank you. And Tom came to that talk too.

There were a lot of magical seeds planted at that Providence Hospital talk—the one they almost canceled two days beforehand because they were worried: “You’re talking about illegal drugs?” But they didn’t cancel it. And now here we all are.

I’m going into week two of a fun summer cold, so I may be muting myself intermittently to clear my airways. Thanks for your patience.

I’m going to share my screen now. Just so you know, once I do that, I won’t be able to see you or read the chat. If you need me, please speak up vocally so I can hear you.
