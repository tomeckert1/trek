### Pharmacokinetics of Psilocybin

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Onset of Effects*:  
  Subjective effects usually peak around 60–90 minutes after oral ingestion. However, this can vary depending on digestive health.

- *Half-Life*:  
  Psilocybin has a half-life of ~3 hours. Multiply any drug’s half-life by 5 to estimate when it’s fully cleared.  
  → 3 hours × 5 = *15 hours* for complete elimination.

- *Body Weight*:  

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
  Surprisingly, body weight does *not* predict how much psilocybin someone needs. A petite person and a 300-pound bodybuilder may need the same dose—or the opposite. It depends on other variables, not size.

- *Elimination*:  
  Psilocin is metabolized in the *liver* (via *phase II glucuronidation*) and eliminated through the *kidneys* in urine.

### Summary of Pharmacokinetics

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Active Form*: Psilocin  
- *Conversion*: Stomach → Intestine → Liver  
- *Action Site*: Brain (via serotonin receptors, especially 5-HT2A)  
- *Elimination*: Liver metabolism + kidney excretion  
- *Variability*: Highly individual—body size isn’t predictive
