### Neuroplasticity: Rewiring the Brain

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Definition:*
Neuroplasticity = the brain’s ability to:
- Adapt and change
- Learn and unlearn
- Reorganize and compensate
- Grow new neuronal connections

*Psilocybin-Induced Effects (Observed in Animals):*
- Neuroendogenesis (new neurons)
- Spinogenesis (new dendritic spines)
- Synaptogenesis (more synapses and improved function)

*Opposite of Depression:*
- Depression = neuronal atrophy, reduced gray matter, shrinking hippocampus
- Psilocybin = promotes growth and restructuring

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Supporting Neuroplasticity (Beyond Psilocybin)*
- Memory games, puzzles
- Physical exercise (including yoga, dance)

*Opposite of Depression:*
- Sleep (brain “cleans” itself during sleep)
- Intermittent fasting
- Making artwork
- Learning a new skill or language
- Other psychedelics (e.g., ketamine)
- Botanical medicine

*Tip:*
Combine integration practices with neuroplasticity boosters (e.g., art or movement) to solidify healing gains post-session.
