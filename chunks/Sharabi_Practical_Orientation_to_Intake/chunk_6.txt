### Relational Skills vs Professional Roles

**Tal Sharabi:**
- Skills like deep listening, presence, and rapport-building *are not "owned" by therapy.*
- Whether licensed or not, *all facilitators* are expected to embody these relational capacities.

*Clinical Skills (e.g., diagnostic assessments)* belong specifically to therapists.

But *relational skills* belong to *all* helpers.

You don't need to "act like a therapist" to be relational, grounded, and effective.

### Setting Up the "Welcome" Orientation

**Tal Sharabi:**
Simon and Tal set up a *live demonstration* of the "Welcome Script" — an organic way to introduce a client to the psilocybin work and intake process.

Key goals of the Welcome:
- *Create spaciousness* for dialogue.
- *Frame expectations* about psilocybin work.
- *Name realities:* no guarantees, no magic bullets.
- *Normalize* the evolving nature of the client-facilitator relationship.
- *Begin building trust* from the very first interaction.

Remember:
The *container starts now* — from the very first conversation.
