### Introduction

**Tal Sharabi:**
I'm so grateful for your lecture today, Simon.  
It sent me into a deep place — and sometimes, when you're working with something, the universe seems to send resources from nowhere to help deepen your understanding.  
Today felt like that.

A podcast I listened to this morning helped anchor some of the concepts we’ll talk about now: *relationship*, *myth*, and *life energy*.

Right now, I want to invite you to hold onto the *depth* Simon just invited us into, even as we move into the *practicality* of how this all looks when you begin working with clients.

### Overview: Where Are We in the Process?

**Tal Sharabi:**
We’re now talking about what happens when a client first reaches out:
- They find your number or website.
- They ask: *"Can we talk about doing a session?"*

*From there, the stages typically look like:*
- *Screening* – basic eligibility and safety check.
- *Intake* – deeper exploration of who the client is, their history, and intentions.
- *Informed Consent* – legal and relational agreements before proceeding.
- *Preparation* – all the work *before* the administration session.

Preparation is the *umbrella* that includes screening, intake, informed consent, rapport building, and orientation.
