### Deepening into Best Practices vs. Legal Minimums

**Tal Sharabi:**
The law requires certain documents and disclosures — but *best practice* is *far more relational*.

Instead of dryly listing facts:
- *Weave these topics into natural conversation.*
- *Empower clients* to feel agency, understanding, and readiness.
- *Invite dialogue*, not just monologue.

*Examples:*
- Instead of handing over the transportation plan, discuss how after a journey, people can feel vulnerable and need trusted support.
- Instead of a checkbox on risks, have a heartfelt conversation about how psilocybin can stir up challenges before bringing clarity.

### Safety Planning

**Tal Sharabi:**
*What is a Safety Plan?*

If a client:
- Has a history of suicidal thoughts or attempts,
- Or is otherwise flagged as high-risk,
...you collaboratively create a *written Safety Plan*:
- *Who* is part of their support system?
- *What* resources (therapists, groups, emergency contacts) are available?
- *What* strategies will they use if emotional turbulence arises?

**Law vs Best Practice:**
- Legally, you just need a written plan.
- Best practice is *relational and personalized* — ensuring the client truly feels prepared.

### Transportation Clarifications

**Question:**
*Can a client take an Uber or Lyft after a session?*

**Tal Sharabi:**
- *Legally:* Yes, ride services are allowed.
- *Best practice (InnerTrek’s choice):* Strongly discourage it.
  - Prefer a *trusted person* picks them up.
  - Example: InnerTrek clients are walked across the street to a hotel.

*Why?*  
- Vulnerability after psilocybin work is real.  
- Clients deserve personal, human support — not a random driver.

### Supportive Touch Guidelines (Oregon)

**Tal Sharabi:**
In Oregon, *supportive touch* is strictly limited to:
- *Hands*
- *Feet*
- *Shoulders*
- *Hugs* (if previously agreed)

*Important Notes:*
- Clients must *pre-consent* to any supportive touch via a signed form.
- Clients can *withdraw consent* at any time for anything they previously agreed to.
- *New consent cannot be added* during the session — if it was not agreed beforehand, it’s not allowed.

*Dual Licensure Clarification:*
- You *can* hold two licenses (e.g., massage therapist and psilocybin facilitator).
- But during sessions, you *cannot practice both professions simultaneously*.
- Oregon is strict about separating roles.

(Colorado may allow more flexibility, depending on profession and rules.)
