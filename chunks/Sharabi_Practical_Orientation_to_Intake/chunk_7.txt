### Demonstration: The Welcome Script in Action

**Simon Yugler:**
Before we dive into a psilocybin session, it’s important to set expectations and create a relational field. The "Welcome" is the first real step in holding the container.
- *Simon plays the facilitator.*
- *Tal plays the client.*

*Welcome Conversation (Demonstration)*

**Simon Yugler:**
Hi Tal, it’s so good to meet you.  
Thanks for being here and for taking the step to reach out.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Thank you. It actually took me about a year to get the courage to contact you. I’m a little nervous.

**Simon Yugler:**
That’s really normal. And I’m so glad you're here now.  
Before we get too deep into your story, I’d like to share a little about how this process works, and what you can expect.

(Short pause for Tal to nod.)

You may have heard a lot about psilocybin — stories of healing, transformation, and profound insight.  
And while those possibilities exist, it's important for me to be honest: *there are no guarantees*.  
Each experience is unique. Some people have life-changing breakthroughs in a single session.  
Others find that a single session opens up work that unfolds over months or even years.

Our work together — starting now — is about building enough trust and relational safety for whatever wants to happen.  
This isn't about "fixing" anything quickly. It's about preparing the ground for real, lasting change.

**Tal Sharabi:**
So you're saying it might take time? And you can’t promise that this one session will change everything?

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly.  
Psilocybin is powerful, but it doesn’t function like a "magic pill."  
It can open doors, but walking through them — and integrating what you find — is an ongoing process.  
Sometimes surprising things come up that need time and care afterward.

**Simon Yugler:**
I also want you to know that both you and I have choice in this process.  
Today, and through our preparation work, we're getting to know each other.  
If at any point you feel like this isn't the right fit — or maybe it's not the right time — you can say so. No pressure, no judgment.

Likewise, if I feel that this work might not be a good match for you right now — whether it's timing, or support needs — I will also share that transparently.  
It’s important to me that you feel fully supported and safe.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Okay. That feels good. Like there's no pressure either way.

**Simon Yugler:**
Exactly.  
You always have agency. You are always at choice.

*Reflection and Debrief After Demo*

**Simon Yugler:**
What did you notice in that interaction?
*Group reflections:*
- Setting clear expectations right away.
- Slowing down urgency.
- Humanizing the relationship — not transactional.
- Naming both the potential and the uncertainty without inducing fear.

**Tal Sharabi:**
I loved how the conversation was *relational*, not a lecture.  
There was an open invitation to dialogue from the start.
