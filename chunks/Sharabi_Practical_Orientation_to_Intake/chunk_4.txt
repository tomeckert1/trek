### The Importance of Informed Consent

**Tal Sharabi:**
Informed consent is:
- A *legal requirement*, and
- An opportunity for *education*, *connection*, and *nervous system regulation*.

Clients often come to us with limited information — maybe they read *Michael Pollan*, or heard a podcast.  
*Listening carefully* gives us a chance to:
- Educate them about what psilocybin work entails.
- Build safety and trust.
- Empower them with their rights and responsibilities.

We'll weave informed consent throughout the preparation process rather than treating it like a dry checklist.

### Legal Requirements: Oregon vs Colorado

**Tal Sharabi:**
*In Oregon:*
- There's an *official Informed Consent form* with *33 sections* you must review.
- Best practice = *relational delivery*, not just handing them a form.
- Clients must also receive:
  - *Bill of Rights*
  - *Screening and Medical Forms*
  - *Transportation Plan*
  - *Supportive Touch Consent* (if applicable)
  - *Data Collection Consent* (opt-in or opt-out)

*In Colorado:*
- No official form yet (as of this training).
- But *informed consent in writing is still required*.
- Must include:
  - Effects and risks of psilocybin
  - Facilitator disclosure
  - Screening and safety planning
  - Transportation plans

*Note:* Colorado forms are evolving fast — always check the latest updates!

### Key Elements Clients Must Be Informed About

**Tal Sharabi:**
- Your facilitator license and grievance procedures
- Confidentiality and its limits
- Legal status of psilocybin (still federally illegal)
- Voluntary nature of participation
- Possible effects: physical, emotional, perceptual
- Potential benefits *and* risks
- Supportive touch guidelines (Oregon specific)
- Transportation planning
- Data collection policies

*Reflection:*
Imagine yourself as the client receiving all this information.  
How would it feel?  
What would you need to hear to feel safe and empowered?

### Forms You Must Know (Oregon)

**Tal Sharabi:**
- *Bill of Rights*
- *Screening Form*
- *Medical Form (Contraindications)*
- *Transportation Plan*
- *Supportive Touch Consent*
- *Medication/Assistive Devices Plan*
- *Support Person Agreement*
- *Consent for Observers*
- *Data Collection Opt-Out*

*Colorado facilitators* will work with a similar set of requirements but may need to create their own forms until state templates are finalized.
