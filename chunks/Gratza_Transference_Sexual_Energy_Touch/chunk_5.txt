### What is a Corrective Experience?

**Gina Gratza:**
A corrective experience is when a dynamic from the past — an old wound, a trauma, an unmet need — gets revisited in the present… but this time, something different happens.

The facilitator (or whoever is standing in that role) offers care, presence, or attunement where previously there was neglect, abuse, or abandonment.

That simple “difference” can be *deeply* healing.

### Case Example: Amy and Sally**

**Gina Gratza:**
Amy, 39, comes to facilitator Sally for a psilocybin session. Amy has trauma from childhood and is fearful of older women, but wants to work on healing it.

During the session, Amy turns away from Sally and begins crying. When Sally checks in, Amy speaks in a childlike voice: “You’re mean.”

Sally gently moves closer and — from a resourced, good-parent energy — says, “I’m here for you. I want to offer care. I’m sorry if I’ve seemed mean. Can I hold your hand?”

Amy takes her hand, begins crying, and reorients her body toward Sally.

Later in integration, Amy shares that she saw Sally as her grandmother — someone she experienced as cold and unwelcoming.

Being able to feel warmth and receive care from Sally became a *corrective emotional experience* — one that allowed a painful relational imprint to begin to shift.
