### Types of Transference Projections**

**Gina Gratza:**
A facilitator might be seen as:

- *The Ideal* — “You’re perfect. You have no flaws. Everything you do is right.”
    - *Risk:* The client puts themselves down. “I’ll never be as good as you.” They lose a sense of their own identity. You may be seen as all-knowing or all-powerful.
    - *Trap:* The facilitator feeds the projection — offering advice, fostering dependency.

- *The Nurturer* — The participant becomes helpless, childlike, wanting hugs or to be held.
    - *Risk:* They never develop personal responsibility.

- *The Frustrator* — The client is guarded, testing you, wanting solutions or advice.
    - *Risk:* The facilitator offers easy solutions, seeing the client as more fragile than they are.

- *The Nonentity* — The facilitator is seen as inanimate, without needs, desires, or problems.
    - *Risk:* The participant doesn’t listen to interventions, creating emotional outbursts or distance.
