### Understanding Countertransference

**Gina Gratza:**

Countertransference is when *you*, the facilitator, have thoughts or feelings about the participant — often unconscious — that arise during the session. These can be *reactions to the client’s transference*, but not always. Countertransference can show up even if the client isn’t projecting onto you.

> It’s your emotional reaction to the participant — *especially when it’s tied to your own past or unresolved material*.

Examples of how countertransference might manifest:
- You feel anxious or responsible for “fixing” them.
- You feel drawn to help them beyond what’s appropriate.
- You feel irritated, distant, or resistant toward them.
- You feel unusually warm, tender, or infatuated.
- You feel insecure or “not enough” in their presence.

Constructive countertransference *can* help the therapeutic process — *but only if you’re aware it’s happening*. If it’s unconscious, it can interfere with your objectivity, feed into projections, or even cause harm.

Knowing and managing your own *personal triggers* is a key part of being a safe facilitator.

> If you notice yourself getting pulled into stories, emotions, or behaviors that feel disproportionate, take a breath. That’s your signal to pause, reflect, and get support.

### Recognizing Countertransference Patterns

**Gina Gratza:**
Watch for:
- Feeling *overprotective* of the participant.
- Rejecting the participant, seeing them as “too needy” or “difficult.”
- Becoming *aloof* or emotionally detached.
- Seeing yourself in the participant and becoming *enmeshed*.
- Feeling *sexually or romantically attracted* to the participant.

That last one — romantic or sexual feelings — needs to be addressed *with absolute clarity*:

> *It is never appropriate to act on sexual or romantic feelings with a client.*
> 
> Not during a session. Not after. Not ever.

The power dynamic is real. The client has placed their trust in you to hold safe space. Crossing that boundary is a serious ethical violation, whether consciously or unconsciously enacted.
