### Introduction

**Mario:**
For today's topic — transference, countertransference, sexual energy, and ethical use of touch — we have Gina Gratza and Tal Sharabi, whom we all know already. They’re experts in somatics and relational psychology. As you know, psilocybin facilitation comes with a very different way of relating with clients.

In non-ordinary states of consciousness, things get more complicated. It's very common for clients to project internal images onto the facilitator — a parent, a loved one, or even an enemy. How do we work with these projections? And how do we notice what we might project onto clients?

When these dynamics are active, they may carry significant implications — including around therapeutic touch or sexual energy. To help us avoid risky situations and remain in ethical alignment, we have Gina and Tal here to share their expertise.

So, I’ll leave you with Gina. Thank you both for bringing this.

**Gina Gratza:**
Thank you, Mario. Hello everyone — it’s nice to see you again. Back to back! You get Tal and me two weeks in a row. That’s exciting.

We’ve had a lovely time revisiting these lectures, which we first taught two years ago, then again last year — and now here we are for the third time. Every year there’s more to add. Like Mario said, things change when you add psilocybin to the mix of countertransference and transference.

These are familiar concepts in the clinical field. But in psychedelics, they’re still being researched and explored. Because when we welcome in altered states of consciousness, it completely changes how we understand these dynamics from a sober perspective.

So tonight, we’re going to explore very large subject matters.

This lecture is not the end of your learning — it’s the beginning of a lifelong inquiry. This content will hold even greater weight when you witness it unfold in front of you, or when you experience it yourself.

**Gina Gratza:**
If you stay in this field long enough, you will encounter these dynamics. You’ll tend to them in community and in consultation. It’s common. Expect it.

Some transference can be very healing. Countertransference may also offer healing — not in the session, but in your own personal growth.

And I always say: please do not do this work alone.

Join consultation groups. Do your own medicine work. Work with a therapist or coach. Being a psilocybin facilitator asks more of you — because you’re holding sacred, intimate space with people. There are responsibilities — to your participants, to yourself, and to the mushroom.

Let us remember to live in respect, reciprocity, reverence, and responsibility.
