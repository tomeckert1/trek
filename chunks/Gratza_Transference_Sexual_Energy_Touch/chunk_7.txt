### Reflective Questions for Facilitators

**Gina Gratza:**
These questions are meant to deepen your self-awareness and help you identify areas of potential vulnerability. Consider journaling or discussing them in consultation:
- What is your relationship to *power*?
- Are *all your needs* being met in your life right now?
- What are your “*sneaky needs*”? (e.g., desire to be liked, admired, needed, adored)
- What parts of yourself do you *disown* or keep in the shadow?
- Do you have a secret desire to be appreciated or validated?
- Are there parts of you that long for connection, touch, or intimacy?
- Do you feel insecure in ways that affect your ability to stay grounded with clients?

> “As long as we refuse to recognize shadow in ourselves, we are in its power.”

Being a psychedelic facilitator means *using your own self as the instrument*. That’s why you need to regularly tune and tend that instrument — through therapy, reflection, consultation, and community.

### Working with Countertransference

**Gina Gratza:**
You are *not* obligated to share your countertransference with a participant. In fact, most of the time you *shouldn’t*.

> The session is for them — not for you.

Your countertransference is yours to work out in:
- Therapy
- Peer consultation groups
- Supervision or mentorship

If you feel that your countertransference has impacted the participant, you might consider whether a *repair conversation* is necessary — but only *after* you’ve explored it with a trusted colleague or supervisor.

> Never bring your countertransference into the client’s space impulsively. It’s not theirs to hold.

### Final Case Example: George and the Solstice Group

**Gina Gratza:**
*Scenario*  
George is preparing to support a group of participants for a summer solstice ceremony. One participant is anxious, asking many questions and expressing distrust in the process. George begins to feel frustrated and privately tells peers that he would prefer not to work with this participant.

Later that evening, George meditates and reflects. He realizes the participant reminds him of his sister — someone he has long felt inadequate in helping. He becomes emotional and shares this realization with his colleagues.

George chooses to stay present with the participant and reassures them that they can rely on him during the session.

**Gina Gratza:**
*Key Takeaways*  
- George acknowledged his *countertransference*.
- He used *self-reflection* to access deeper understanding.
- He shared with *trusted colleagues*, not the client.
- He was able to separate his emotional process from the participant’s needs.
- He maintained the integrity of the *shared healing container*.
