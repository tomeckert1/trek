### Working with Transference

**Gina Gratza:**
During medicine sessions, I let it move. I don’t try to fix or label it. Every case is different, and I meet each client as the unique person they are.

I show up with deep care — again, think of the “good parent self.” I move with the energy in the room like in Aikido — flowing where needed.

Sometimes a client will reach for my hand. I hold it briefly. If they look at me with intense eye contact, I meet their gaze with care — but then I often break it gently. I look past their eyes to break any trance that may be forming.

Remember — they’re on a hallucinogen. They might see you as a devil, a goddess, a sibling — anything. If you hold eye contact too long, it can create a trance. That might be helpful… or it might not. I lean into the ambiguity, always watching.

If someone is gripping my hand tightly — “Don’t leave!” — I stay. But eventually I slowly pull away, helping them feel their own strength. The point is to support them in being with themselves, not in becoming dependent on us.

I've had participants project the mother role onto me. In one case, a woman kept looping for a long time. I held her hand and reassured her: “You’re okay. I’m okay. It’s all okay.” That sense of safety — of being held — can be what’s needed to go deeper.

Each facilitator works with transference in their own way. If a participant later identifies it during integration, you might reflect with gentle curiosity:
- “I noticed you looking at me for a long time… Do you remember that?”
- “I noticed that when ___ happened, you seemed affected. What was your experience?”

**Gina Gratza:**
Ask what *they* noticed. Let them lead. Just because you observed something and assumed it meant one thing doesn’t make it true. More often than not, your guess is off — this is psychedelics, after all. You have no idea what’s actually going on in their inner world.

*Let their unfolding happen naturally. Don’t overlay your assumptions.*

I don’t always call out transference directly. As Kile Goertzen (formerly Kile Ortigo) writes: the professional’s job is to hold the “I’m okay, you’re okay” stance lightly and gracefully. Always look for ways to empower the client, inviting them into mutual respect and self-trust.

But — and this is important — *deep connection with clients makes facilitators more ethically vulnerable*.

Let me repeat that: *Deep connection with clients makes us more ethically vulnerable.*

You might think, “Well, I just won’t have deep connection.” But then… you may not be doing this work at the depth it’s meant to be done.

**Gina Gratza:**
This work is *relational*. You will form relationships. That’s why I deeply value Kileya Taylor’s *Chart of Vulnerabilities* — a framework to help facilitators stay in right relationship.

Each point on her chart — money, sex, power, love, oneness — is a potential site of transference, countertransference, projection, and enactment.

This “tension of opposites” is often alive in the transference dyad. It provides an opportunity for healing through *corrective experience*.
