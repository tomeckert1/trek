### Understanding Transference

**Gina Gratza:**
Transference is reliving a pattern. It’s when a client unconsciously transfers feelings about someone from their past onto the facilitator.

As Mario said earlier, this could be a mother, a brother, a child — it could also be a perpetrator. In psychedelic sessions, it can even be angels, deities, or demons.

This is one aspect that differentiates psychedelics from traditional clinical settings — people may project mythic, symbolic, or hallucinatory figures onto the facilitator. These projections can be positive or negative.

The *power differential* increases a client’s vulnerability. It amplifies their core human needs and longings, and it makes them more susceptible to transference.

Projections are especially powerful on psilocybin.

So how does this arise in a session?

**Gina Gratza:**
It creates openings for emotionally corrective experiences. Imagine someone sees you as a parent — maybe their actual parent was misattuned or neglectful. And you simply offer them a blanket. That simple caring gesture might bring them to tears.

That small act might feel deeply cathartic. It offers them something nurturing they didn’t receive in childhood.

Kylea Taylor — I know you all are reading her book — she says: *assume transference is happening in some way to some degree.* That way, we can be prepared to embody our “good parent self”: caring, respectful, encouraging, protective — a true well-wisher of our client. Someone willing to apologize and take corrective action when we’re wrong.

I really resonate with that. I try to call in the highest version of myself — the most compassionate version — so that someone can feel safe enough to surrender. And sometimes, that surrender may be into a regressive place. What they need in that moment is a loving, supportive presence — one they didn’t get growing up.

When a client is projecting positively onto us, it can also reflect disowned parts of themselves. The qualities they see in us are actually within them — parts they want to own but haven’t yet integrated.

So we just notice that. We meet it with loving presence.

**Gina Gratza:**
For example, a client might cry when you give them a blanket and say, “I never got this from my mom.” There’s something deeply moving happening inside them. And yes, it may bring up things for you too.

But remember — it’s their process. It’s important for them to go through it. So offer loving presence, give space, and know when to lean in and when to lean back.

This is an art. It’s like Aikido. You’re moving with energy in a very subtle way. Your sensitivity builds with experience — especially if you’ve been on the receiving end of this yourself. If you’ve seen someone through the lens of a projection — as a loving sibling, a parent, a caregiver — you know what it’s like.

You may choose to educate participants about transference, but don’t get overly clinical. It’s a complex subject, and sometimes talking about it can confuse people.

I don’t always bring it up unless it arises organically. If it emerges in a session, let it emerge. I wouldn’t say mid-session, “Oh, you’re experiencing transference.” Let the process unfold. If they bring it up in integration, then you can explore it together.

Transference is one form of *projection*, but there are others — including defensive projections that act as protection mechanisms. Carl Jung called this the “shadow self.” These projections help reduce anxiety and internal conflict.

**Gina Gratza:**
One clinical example: a man feels attracted to a colleague but doesn’t want to admit it. So instead, he accuses the colleague of flirting with him. That’s projection as a defense mechanism.

Most of what we know about transference and countertransference comes from psychotherapy. There’s less literature specifically focused on psychedelic facilitation. But it’s growing. For now, we adapt what’s useful.

When I say “counselor,” I mean facilitator. When I say “client,” I mean participant. Just so you understand my framing.
