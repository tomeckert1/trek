### Final Reflections

**Gina Gratza:**
Ah, thank you, Tal. That was beautiful.

I also want to remind everyone:
> This field is always unfolding. Both internally and externally.

That’s a gift—and it’s a challenge.

So blessings and love to each of you as you walk the path of becoming a facilitator.

**Gina Gratza:**
It is a sacred thing to want to hold space for another human being’s deep process. That’s gorgeous. And it’s powerful.

If more people in the world knew how to do that, maybe we’d be closer to peace.

So keep doing your work. Keep tending to your own healing. That’s how we do this responsibly.

Thank you.
