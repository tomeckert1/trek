### Opening & Introduction

**Tal Sharabi:**
I'm very excited to have Gina here today. Gina and I are friends and colleagues. We worked together at InnerTrek as lead educators from the very beginning. I joined a little later than Jason, Gina, and Erica, but it was really special to create, dream, and collaborate with these brilliant minds and hearts. Gina has been a driving force behind InnerTrek. Many of you might not know this, but for three cohorts, it was beautiful to work with her and witness her enthusiasm, grace, and talent.

Gina is a licensed marriage and family therapist and a licensed facilitator. She has spent over a decade supporting individuals, couples, and families through the complexities of trauma, fractured relationships, and personal transformation. She specializes in psychedelic-assisted facilitation, deeply influenced by her work with trauma and eating disorders.

Her experience includes trainings with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) for PTSD, and the Polaris Insight Center for Ketamine. She's also served as a program coordinator and lead educator at InnerTrek, nurturing future facilitators and expanding holistic healing practices. Gina is currently engaged in psychedelic research at the Portland VA with the Social Neuroscience and Psychotherapy Lab as a study therapist.

Gina is a seeker, a playful dancer, an embodied woman, and a poet. She continuously moves toward her authentic self and loves engaging others interested in this dance.

So good to have you, Gina.

**Gina Gratza:**
Oh, thank you so much. So good to be back.

Hello, everyone. Nice to see you in these tiny little boxes. I scrolled through to get a sense of who's here today. It's my first time meeting many of you in this way.

I'll be facilitating a practicum with many of you in the fall, I believe, so this is our first introduction. Hello!

I'm very excited about today’s subject.

Like Tal said, I used to support InnerTrek programming, and I stepped back to build more into my women’s empowerment work. Now I'm coming back as a guest educator around topics that are deeply meaningful to me—and this is one of them. Having Tal here supporting the conversation is really lovely, because her and I are trained in so many of the same modalities and we work in very similar ways. So, to talk about the nervous system today with her presence feels like icing on the cake.
