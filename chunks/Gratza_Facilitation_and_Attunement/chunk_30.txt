### Naming Power Differentials

**Tamara Golden (participant):**
You mentioned naming the power differential in prep. Can you give examples of how you do that?

**Gina Gratza:**
Yes. It’s important to acknowledge that the person is *trusting* you with their vulnerability.

Here’s how I might say it:
> “This is a paid service, and I recognize that I’m holding responsibility for your safety. There may feel like there’s a power imbalance. I want to acknowledge that, and honor it by being as ethical, present, and respectful as I can be.”

Or:
> “This is a courageous thing you’re doing—working with psychedelics and entrusting me to hold that space. I don’t take that lightly.”

**Gina Gratza:**
Naming it helps your client feel seen and respected. And it reminds *you* of the responsibility you carry.
