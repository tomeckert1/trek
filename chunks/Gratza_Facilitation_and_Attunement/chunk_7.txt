### The Role of Safe Connection

**Gina Gratza:**
All of that—neural flexibility, insight, healing—is supported and enhanced by *safe connection*.

That’s where you come in as facilitators. Your connection with the participant is key to helping their nervous system relax and integrate the experience.

That connection isn’t just about the journey itself. It begins the moment you connect with the person—on the consult call, during intake, in preparation. It needs to be prioritized throughout the entire arc of the experience: consult → intake → prep → journey → integration.

Connection isn’t a means to an end. It’s the container.

After the journey, when someone is coming down, they may have been flying high—like a kite that’s lost its string. You’re there to help bring them back down, safely.

You help them *ground*:  
- Locate their body  
- Use their five senses (What do you hear? Smell? Feel?)  

**Gina Gratza:**
- Say their name  
- Offer grounding foods—salts, soups, fruits  
- Change the environment—walk around, feel the Earth  
- Take your time—don’t rush it

If the journey ends in five hours, you might still be there for eight. This is sacred work. Don’t schedule anything after a journey.

If you’re thinking, “I’ve got a concert to go to—can we wrap this up?”… that will be felt. That’s abandonment. And it damages the connection.

So again, *connection must be present the whole time*.
