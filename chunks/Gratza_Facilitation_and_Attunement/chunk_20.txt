### Core Skills of Attunement
  
**Gina Gratza:**
Here are key skills that support attunement:
- *Curiosity* and *compassion*  
- Being okay with not knowing  
- Gentle validation (e.g., “I’m right here,” “You’re not alone”)  
- Grounded touch (with consent)  
- Presence—not problem-solving  
- Just *being with* the person

This is *loving presence*. It’s what doulas do. They’re not doing, they’re *being*—holding, breathing, reminding someone to drink water.

That’s your role.

When your participant is dysregulated, you must stay regulated. Your tone, eye contact, and posture help them settle.
