### Love as an Act of Presence

**Gina Gratza:**
I was recently reading *True Love* by Thích Nhất Hạnh.

Facilitating for someone in an altered state is an *act of love*.

To be attuned to someone in their most vulnerable places is deeply relational.

In psychotherapy research, it’s not the specific modality that leads to better outcomes—it’s the *quality of the therapeutic relationship*.

I believe the same is true in psychedelic work.

Your presence—compassionate, attuned, grounded—is what creates the healing container.
