### Holding the Relational Field

**Tal Sharabi:**
Let’s talk about the *relational field* for a moment. What is it?

**Gina Gratza:**
It’s the *shared space* between you and your participant. A space charged with physical, emotional, and energetic dynamics.

Trauma-informed facilitators like Tal and I are trained to perceive this field.

It includes:
- Body language  
- Tone  
- Subtle cues  
- Energetic presence  
- Nervous system responses  

Your *animal body* tracks the other person’s animal body—always.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Exactly. Our physiology is always in conversation. And we’re also *fed* by each other’s nervous systems. So tuning in to the relational field is not just a skill—it’s a form of *care*.

Many of us do this naturally. But if we bring *conscious attention* to it, it becomes an incredible tool for healing.
