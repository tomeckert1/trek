### Signs of Dysregulation and Returning to the Body

We had a question in the chat:

Start by asking:

If the answer is no, that’s the first clue.

Most people are walking around disembodied—living entirely in the mind. Our culture has emphasized intellectualism at the expense of emotional and somatic intelligence.

So begin to *bring the elevator down* from the head to the body.

**Gina Gratza:**
Your body will tell you when you’re dysregulated:
- Jaw clenching  
- Fists tightening  
- Shallow breath  
- Feeling frozen or needing to run

These are somatic cues. Learn to listen.

It’s okay if this is new. You’re not alone.
