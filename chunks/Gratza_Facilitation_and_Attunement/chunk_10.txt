### Thomas Hübl and Ancestral Attunement

**Gina Gratza:**
Thomas Hübl is a beautiful teacher in this field. Tal and I both love his work. He teaches deeply about these subjects—attunement, trauma, ancestral healing.

I once took a five-month course with him on ancestral healing. Highly recommend his book and online offerings if this speaks to you.

All of this—attunement, presence—starts with the *first consultation call*. Then intake. Then prep. It’s present the whole time.

A thorough intake helps you track where more connection may be needed:
- Edges  
- Traumas  
- Needs  
- Resources  
- Body language  

If someone starts crying when a topic comes up, that’s a connection moment. That’s a cue. “How can I support you now—and if this comes up in the journey?”

That’s service.

### Cultural Awareness and Trauma-Informed Care

**Gina Gratza:**
Here are things I look for in intake:

- *Cultural awareness:*  
  Make space in your questionnaire for people to share who they are, how they’re showing up. Socially locate yourself, too—acknowledge your own biases or blind spots.

- *Being trauma-informed:*  
  It’s not a buzzword. It’s a commitment. Take trainings. Read books. This six-month program is amazing—but it’s not enough. Keep learning. For the rest of your life.

- *Spiritual awareness:*  
  Ask about spirituality and religious trauma. It helps you understand what may or may not be appropriate in session—like specific songs or ritual forms.

**Gina Gratza:**
- *Ancestral lineage work:*  
  This is deep work. If it’s new to you, start reading. Explore it. We are working with altered states, with spirit, with mystery. There is so much we don’t know.

- *Collective trauma:*  
  Climate change. War. Displacement. These things live in our bones. People may bring that pain into session. How will you hold it? Can you open your heart without crumbling?

- *Spatial awareness:*  
  This overlaps with trauma-informed care. Don’t assume closeness is comforting—or that distance is neutral. Ask: “Would you like me closer or farther?” Give them *agency*.

- *Relational intelligence:*  
  Learn to track the space between you. Learn to notice your own nervous system. If something activates you—don’t bury it. Bring it to consultation, therapy, mentorship. Don’t let your reactions bleed into the field.
