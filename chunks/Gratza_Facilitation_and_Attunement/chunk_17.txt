### Attunement Visualization Exercise

**Gina Gratza:**
Let’s drop in for an exercise.

If you’re driving, skip this. Otherwise, find a quiet spot.

Close your eyes or lower your gaze. Come back to your breath.

Feel the cool air through the nostrils. Lengthen the spine. Relax the jaw. Soften the shoulders.

Let’s play with some visualization:

**Gina Gratza:**
*1. Imagine someone you trust deeply.*  
Someone who’s easy to be with. See them sitting across from you.
- Notice their facial expression, posture, energy.
- How do you feel in their presence?
- What’s your own posture like?
- What’s your breath like?

Just breathe with that for a moment.

**Gina Gratza:**
*2. Now imagine they leave—and a new person enters.*  
Someone you have a mildly challenging relationship with. Nothing deeply traumatic—just someone who irritates you a little.
- Notice their presence.
- What’s your body doing now?
- Are you leaning back? Tensing? Holding your breath?

Track the difference.

*3. Let that person go, and return to yourself.*  
Breathe. Open your eyes.

Look again at that object we chose at the beginning—something that makes you smile. Let it help you reorient to the room.
