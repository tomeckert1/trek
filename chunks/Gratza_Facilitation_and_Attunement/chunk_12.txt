### Co-regulation and Somatic Presence

**Gina Gratza:**
Co-regulation* happens through attunement.

When you are steady, others can find balance with your nervous system.

Your breath, your voice, your posture—they help someone else regulate.

You’re not problem-solving. You’re not fixing.

**Gina Gratza:**
You’re *being with* them.

You are the anchor.

Sometimes I just sit close, breathe more audibly, make a soft sound like “mmm,” to let them know: I’m here.

That’s co-regulation.
