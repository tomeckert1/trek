### Holding Space Without Collapse

**Gina Gratza:**
And remember—sometimes someone brings *collective trauma* into the field: war, climate grief, cultural displacement.

You can’t collapse under the weight of it. But you can’t numb to it either.

So the question becomes:  
> How do I open my heart wide enough to meet this person—without becoming overwhelmed?

That’s the art. That’s the work.
