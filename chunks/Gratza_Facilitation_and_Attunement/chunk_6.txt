### Psilocybin and Brain Connectivity

**Gina Gratza:**  
You’ve already learned about psilocybin in other lectures, but let’s review to keep the thread going.

Psilocybin is converted into *psilocin* in the body. Psilocin is what actually interacts with the brain.

Psilocin mimics *serotonin*—a natural chemical that regulates mood, appetite, and perception. It binds to *5-HT2A receptors* in the brain—regions tied to emotion, imagination, and sense of self.

**Gina Gratza:**
This enhances communication between different parts of the brain.

If you’ve seen the images from the *Imperial College research*, you’ll remember the diagrams showing a “normal brain” versus a brain on psychedelics—with all the new neural connections lit up like a web.

Under psychedelics:  
- Brain regions that don’t normally talk to each other start firing together  
- You get flexible, creative brain states  
- This is *neuroplasticity*—new insights, new perspectives  
- Vivid imagery, altered perceptions, hallucinations  
- Emotional release, spiritual connection, unity, ego disillusionment

Psilocybin *softens the default mode network*—that’s the region linked to our ego, identity, and ruminating thoughts. With it softened, we experience a widening of the lens. We move beyond ourselves. That’s why people often report relief from depression, anxiety, and rumination.
