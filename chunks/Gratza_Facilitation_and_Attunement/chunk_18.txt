### Debrief: Sharing Insights

**Gina Gratza:**
Let’s share.

What did you notice between the two? Any shifts in breathing, posture, emotions?

**Natalie (participant):**
With the safe person, I felt open and peaceful. With the difficult person, it was like opposing magnets—there was energy, but no connection. It wasn’t painful, just clearly not aligned.

**Gina Gratza:**
That’s a beautiful image—opposing magnets.

**KK (participant):**
I felt constriction. My jaw tightened. I teared up—not from sadness, but from the fear of conflict. It happened so fast.

**Gina Gratza:**
That’s so important. Being able to track what’s happening in your nervous system—and recognize that in others—is essential.

**Maria (participant):**
When I imagined the difficult person, I lost touch with my body. I went into my head. It was like I couldn’t be present anymore.

**Gina Gratza:**
Thank you for that. Yes—detachment from the body can be a protective response.

Now imagine: what if a participant felt that way about you during a journey?

What would you do?

How would you rebuild connection when there’s a rupture?

Let’s talk about it.
