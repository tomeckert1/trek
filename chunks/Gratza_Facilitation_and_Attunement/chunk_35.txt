### The Emotional Landscape of Facilitation

**Tal Sharabi:**
And sometimes dysregulation shows up emotionally:
- People pleasing  
- Self-abandonment  
- Dissociation  
- Conflict avoidance

These are also signs. And they’re relational.

Tracking your own regulation is an act of care for others, too.

### Closing Integration Visualization

**Gina Gratza:**
Let’s integrate what Gina has shared with a final practice.

Close your eyes or settle into stillness. Wiggle your body if you need to. Let yourself arrive.

Now imagine the *you* that holds all of what we’ve talked about today:

**Tal Sharabi:**
- Attunement  
- Boundaries  
- Presence  
- Co-regulation  
- Ethical care

What does that version of you feel like?
What’s your posture?  
Your breath?  
Your way of speaking?  
Your movement?

Let yourself *connect to that version of you*. Say hello. That version of you already lives within you.

This isn’t about becoming something else—it’s about remembering who you are.
