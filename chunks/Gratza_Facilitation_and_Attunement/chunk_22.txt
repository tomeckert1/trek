### Psychedelics and Attachment

**Gina Gratza:**
Psilocybin softens defenses, increases emotional openness, and activates *attachment patterns*.

That means your presence as a facilitator becomes even more influential.

People may:
- Project onto you  
- Idealize you  
- Transfer childhood dynamics onto you  

**Gina Gratza:**
- Experience deep longing or vulnerability  

That’s why the *power differential* must be named up front. During preparation, I suggest saying something like:

> “I realize it takes a lot of courage to trust someone you barely know to hold space for you in a vulnerable state. I don’t take that for granted. I honor the privilege of holding this container, and I will do so ethically and responsibly.”

Let them know you are aware of the dynamic.
