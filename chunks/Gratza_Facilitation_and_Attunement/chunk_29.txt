### Navigating Flirtation or Compliments During Journeys

**Joe (participant):**
What if someone pushes a boundary—like saying they want to hang out or flooding you with compliments?

**Gina Gratza:**
It depends on the energy, but I generally *receive and redirect*.

If someone says something flattering—like “you’re amazing” or “we should spend time together”—I might say:
> “Thank you, I hear that. Let’s stay with your experience right now. We’ll revisit that later.”

You want to *acknowledge* them without getting entangled.

If they persist, just stay grounded. “I’m here for you. Let’s stay with what’s alive for you right now.”

Let their emotional material be the focus—not your relationship.

**Tal Sharabi:**
I also have multiple mentors—one for ancestral trauma, one for education and holding students, one for somatic trauma work.

Different specialists for different needs. That’s key.
