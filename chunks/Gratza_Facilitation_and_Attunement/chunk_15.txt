### When to End Supportive Touch

**Malorie (participant):**
Hi. I work as a sitter in a ketamine clinic, and I typically end supportive touch when I see someone’s breathing regulate or their emotional release soften. In your opinion, when is the best time to end supportive touch?

**Gina Gratza:**
Such a good question. And honestly, it’s not easily summarized.

It’s a felt sense. Psilocybin journeys are longer than ketamine, and psilocybin is more relational.

Here’s how I think about it:
- If I’m holding someone’s hand and they’re gripping tight, I stay until they soften their grip.  
- If they’re crying and seem to be moving through something, I may wait until the emotion has shifted.

**Gina Gratza:**
Sometimes people cry for hours.

When I pull away, I do it slowly—so it almost leaves the *imprint* of my hand behind. Then I stay seated next to them. It becomes energetic. Like Reiki. Like parenting a child to sleep.

**Malorie:**
Wow, yes. That’s exactly what I was thinking—like putting a baby to bed.

**Gina Gratza:**
Exactly. When they feel support, then your hand leaves, they also realize—they can support themselves. Both experiences are important.

If I held them the whole time, what parts of them got to show up?
