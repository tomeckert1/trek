### Let Praise Pass Through You

**Gina Gratza:**
Here’s a story:

Once, a client called me Madonna. And I love Madonna. That’s the ultimate compliment.

So I smiled and said, “Thank you. I love Madonna too.” Then I let it go.

Don’t attach to the projections—positive or negative.
> Let praise go in one ear and out the other.  
> That way, criticism can do the same.

If you attach to one, you’ll be wrecked by the other.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes. Hold the projection in the *relational field*—not in your ego.

Don’t run from it. Don’t grab onto it. Just hold it neutrally.

There’s richness there. There’s information in the projection. If you stay grounded, you can use it to support the client’s unfolding.

**Gina Gratza:**
Exactly. Attuned neutrality. Holding the field, not reacting from ego.

That’s what makes this work sacred.
