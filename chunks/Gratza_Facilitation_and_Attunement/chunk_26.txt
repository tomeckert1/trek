### Building a Support System

**Gina Gratza:**
Let’s talk about your *support team*.

Who do you call when something comes up in your facilitation work?

You are human. And humans make mistakes. That’s inevitable.

What matters is:
- Who’s on your team?
- Who can you turn to for supervision, consultation, feedback?
- If you don’t have a team—*start building one.*

You’ll need:

**Gina Gratza:**
- A therapist  
- A consultant  
- Colleagues you trust  
- A mentor  
- A supervision group (ideally ongoing)

You don’t have to do this alone.

Don’t become a *savior* figure. That’s a dangerous trap.

Don’t think you’re the only one who can help your client. If something is outside your scope, refer them to someone else. That’s ethical care.
