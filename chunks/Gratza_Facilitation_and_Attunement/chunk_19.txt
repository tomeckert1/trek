### Cultivating Attunement as a Facilitator

**Gina Gratza:**
So—how do we *cultivate attunement*?

First, we slow down. And we regulate.

It’s human to want others to like us. If someone doesn’t, it can feel scary—especially if we have wounds around belonging. So when that’s triggered, pause. Stop. Drop into your body. Regulate.

> *My motto: Stop. Drop. Regulate.*  
> Stop what you’re doing. Drop into your body. Regulate your nervous system.

**Gina Gratza:**
That doesn’t mean ignore your injury—it means tend to it *later* with your therapist or mentor. Not during the session.

When you’re calm and grounded, you invite others into calm with you.

*Attunement means listening with your whole body.*

It’s:
- Your words  
- Your tone  
- Your facial expression  
- Your posture  
- Your breath  

If I say, “No, I’m totally fine. We’re good. I’m not mad,” but my face says otherwise… people will feel the misalignment.

Regulate your nervous system so that your *body* matches your *words*.
