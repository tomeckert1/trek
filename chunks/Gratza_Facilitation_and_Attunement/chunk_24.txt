### Boundaries, Boundaries, Boundaries

**Gina Gratza:**
Boundaries are not rigid walls. They’re clarity.
- Boundaries help prevent *enmeshment* and *dependency*.  
- They prevent *retraumatization*.  
- They create a *safe relational field*.  

Don’t build a dynamic where someone needs your validation to feel okay.

**Gina Gratza:**
Even if you love affirming your clients and want them to feel empowered—do it in a way that doesn’t create a *dependency loop*.

Here’s an example:
If a participant says,  
> “You’re the only one who sees me. You understand me better than anyone.”

And you respond,  
> “Yes, I do. Here’s my number—call me anytime, day or night.”

**Gina Gratza:**
That’s not okay. That’s not a safe boundary. You’re blending roles.

After a session ends, *I recommend a 24-hour window* where you’re available. After that, have clear limits.

Boundaries make the work sustainable. For you and for them.
