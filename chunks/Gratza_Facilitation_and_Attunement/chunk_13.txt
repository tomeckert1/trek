### Supportive Touch and Consent

**Gina Gratza:**
Let’s talk about *touch*.

It’s a big topic—and I think Emma already spoke with you all about consent, which is vital. Touch has to be *safe* and *attuned*.

Always ask before touching. Always *announce* before you touch.

You don’t know where your participant is—they could be deep in a vision, on a boat in the middle of an ocean, or speaking with an ancestor—and suddenly, there’s a hand on their shoulder. That can feel like a violation.

So ask:
> “Would you like a hand on your shoulder?”

If they say no, or simply raise a hand in refusal—respect that. If they say yes, great. Then *how* you touch matters.

**Gina Gratza:**
It’s not rubbing. It’s not patting. It’s not constant.

It’s a *firm, steady holding*. A brief anchor. And then you move away.

Touch is an anchor of presence—not a lingering act.

If you’re working with someone who has trauma history, explore this *before* the journey:
- What comes up for you around touch?
- Is it hard for you to ask for touch?

**Gina Gratza:**
- How would you like me to offer it?
- What should I say if I sense touch might be helpful?

Also reflect on your own boundaries:
- Are there forms of touch you’re not comfortable with?
- Do you have limits—like not touching feet or faces?

Be honest with yourself, and communicate that clearly with your participant so no one is surprised on journey day.

If you don’t feel comfortable offering touch, let them know early. Unmet expectations can be painful.
