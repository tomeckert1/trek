### Consultation, Reciprocity, and Investing in Growth

**Joe (participant):**
Should your therapist, mentor, and consultant all be different people? What does your team look like?

**Gina Gratza:**
Great question.

Yes—diversify. Different people offer different support.

For example:
- I have a plant medicine integration specialist  
- A personal therapist for family-of-origin work  
- A psilocybin mentor who’s been facilitating for decades

**Gina Gratza:**
Each person supports me in a different domain.

Also: *honor people’s time.* Don’t expect free labor. Pay your consultants and mentors if you’re able. If not, offer trade, or acknowledge the value of what they bring. Respect experience.

This is a profession. Let’s treat each other’s time and wisdom with integrity.

I’ve spent *tens of thousands of dollars* on my mental health over the years—and it’s been worth every penny. That work allows me to stay grounded and show up ethically.
