### Nervous System Awareness and Regulation

**Gina Gratza:**
You are responsible for your own nervous system. Period.

Because under psychedelics, people get a kind of *sixth sense*. They feel everything. If your energy shifts, they know.

Say you get a hard text message and it shifts your mood—even if you don’t say anything, they’ll feel it.

So you must learn to regulate.
