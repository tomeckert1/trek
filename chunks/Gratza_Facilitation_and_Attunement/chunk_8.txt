### Attunement and Connection

**Gina Gratza:**
This is my favorite part of psilocybin facilitation. And I believe it’s the most important.

We are wired for connection. And when we’re in safe connection, we can let go into experience.

So let’s talk about *attunement*.

Attunement is being emotionally, physically, and energetically present with another human being.

**Gina Gratza:**
It means:
- Listening to what they’re saying  
- Showing with your body that you’re there  
- Being fully, heartfully with them  

And this goes far beyond psilocybin work. Honestly, it should be a movement. We’ve become so distracted by our devices and busy lives that we forget how vital authentic connection is.

We’ll do an exercise on this soon, but just remember: Attunement is how we say to someone, “I see you. I’m here. I’m listening.” Not thinking about what I’ll say next. Just present.

**Gina Gratza:**
And it’s rare. And it’s a skill.

We’re not born knowing how to attune, unless we had, like, a specialist attachment parent—which most of us didn’t. So we need to practice.

That means learning:
- Mindful awareness  
- Nervous system regulation  
- Groundedness in ourselves  

Because we can’t attune to others if we’re dysregulated ourselves.
