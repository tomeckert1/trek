### Attunement and Money: Ethical Considerations

**Gina Gratza:**
Another thing to reflect on—*money and ethics*.

If psychedelic facilitation is your only income stream, you may begin to *need* clients in ways that cloud your boundaries.

You may stop saying “no” when you should.

You may blur ethical lines because you’re trying to pay rent.

So: be in right relationship with money. Kaila Taylor’s *Ethics of Caring* has a great chart on this. Print it. Refer to it often.

Let boundaries serve you and your clients.

### Navigating Social Encounters with Clients

**student:**
What if I run into a client unexpectedly in a social setting—like ecstatic dance? Do you establish boundaries for that in advance?

**Gina Gratza:**
Yes, that’s something to cover in prep.

Here’s what I say:
> “If I see you out in the world, I won’t come up to you, out of respect for your privacy. But if you want to approach me, you’re absolutely welcome.”

Why? Because you never know if they’re with work colleagues or family members who don’t know about their journey work. You don’t want to accidentally expose them.

If they greet me, I’ll return the greeting warmly. If not, I take the cue and hold the boundary.
