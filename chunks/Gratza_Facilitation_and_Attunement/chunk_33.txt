### Boundaries with Self and Self-Care

Let’s not forget—*boundaries are not just for your clients*. They’re also for *you*.

I have a friend who facilitates psilocybin journeys for a lot of clients. When I asked, “That seems like a lot—are you making time for self-care?” they said, “Oh, it’s easy for me. I’m fine.”

But I asked:
- Are you tending to your relationships?  
- Are you nourishing your body?  
- Are you attending to that injury you’ve been ignoring?

Sometimes the work doesn’t *feel* hard—but your life begins to suffer in subtle ways.

So ask yourself:  
> Am I making space for my body? My healing? My loved ones?

This work is beautiful—but it’s demanding. Boundaries protect your capacity to keep showing up well.
