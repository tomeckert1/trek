### Practicing Touch During Practicum

**Gina Gratza:**
If you're preparing for your practicum—or having someone sit for you—*play with touch*.

If you usually think, “I don’t want to be touched,” maybe open yourself to it. Let yourself feel what it’s like.

Try:
- Asking for supportive touch  
- Saying “I’m good now, thank you”  
- Seeing what it feels like to be helped walking to the bathroom

Your practicum isn’t just about having a profound experience—it’s about *learning how to facilitate*.

Let the mushroom teach you. Let yourself explore the relational field.
