### Grounded Presence in Touch

**Gina Gratza:**
When you offer touch, your *presence* matters.

If you’re shaky, anxious, or ungrounded—your client will feel that in your hand.

If you’re highly sensitive, you may feel their energy in your own body as well. So again: practice grounded presence.

Can I add something here?

Let’s remember how heightened the senses become under psilocybin. Sight, smell, touch—everything is amplified.

So when you provide touch, consider the kind of energy you’re bringing. It should be *grounding*, *calm*, and *gentle*—something that soothes an activated nervous system.
