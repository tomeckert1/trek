### Ethical Boundaries and Responsibility

**Gina Gratza:**
You have an *ethical responsibility*.

And let me say it plainly:  
> *It is never okay to sleep with your clients.* Ever.

Even if they initiate. Even if they idealize you. Even if they beg you.

Why?

Because they were vulnerable, and you were the one holding the container. You helped them open. You held their safety. And now, they’re projecting all kinds of things onto you—healer, savior, lover, god, demon. That’s *transference*.

You must never exploit that.

**Gina Gratza:**
Even positive projection can be misleading.

> If you believe it when someone calls you a goddess, it will hurt that much more when someone else calls you a demon.

Stay centered. Let it pass through you.

**Tal Sharabi:**
I love reframing “transference” and “countertransference” as *human projection*.

It brings it out of professional jargon and back to heart-level reality. We’re constantly assessing each other. It’s human. Let’s just meet it with curiosity and compassion.
