### Attunement Under Psilocybin

**Gina Gratza:**
Under psilocybin, people are especially vulnerable and sensitive. They may not be able to say what they need—but they’ll *feel* whether they’re being met with care.

You don’t have to be a mind reader. You just need to notice.

If they’re in distress, and they’ve indicated in their intake that they don’t want to be touched, maybe you don’t touch them—but you say, “I’m right here with you.” That simple statement can let them know you’re present.

Attunement helps:
- Regulate the nervous system  
- Build trust  
- Create safety in the container  
- Deepen emotional and somatic processing  
- Support integration through felt connection  
- Offer *corrective experiences*  

**Gina Gratza:**
Here’s an example:

One participant was crying and visibly cold. A blanket was gently placed on them. They began to cry even more—not from distress, but from being cared for. That simple act triggered a memory of not receiving nurturing from their mother. The blanket became a symbol of attunement—and it opened a door to healing old wounds.

That’s the power of relational presence.
