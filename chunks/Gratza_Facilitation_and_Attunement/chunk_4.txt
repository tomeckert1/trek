### Centering Practice: Arriving in the Body

**Gina Gratza:**
Okay, the nervous system. I originally titled this “The Nervous System,” but I really wanted to call it “Psychedelics and Human Connection.” Because yes, this is about the nervous system in science language—but really, what we’re talking about from a spiritual and energetic place is human connection.

I’m going to bring up our PowerPoint, and I’ll have it sent to you after this.

For questions today, please use Slido. If things pile up and Tal wants to invite a few in while I’m talking, that’s okay. I’m not attached to any particular pace—we’ll go with the flow.

Let’s begin by arriving in our bodies.

If you're driving, keep your eyes on the road and stay safe. But if you're at home or in a space where you can drop in, go ahead and close your eyes or lower your gaze.

**Gina Gratza:**
Simply become aware of your breath.

Notice the cool air entering through your nostrils as you inhale... and slowly breathing out.

Once again, breathing in—beginning to sense the expansion of your body...

And on the exhale, feeling the slight contraction.

Just notice your breath at a pace that feels good to your body.

Maybe noticing any tension or sensations in your body. You don’t need to change anything—just be aware.

**Gina Gratza:**
Whatever you were doing before this—work, parenting—let your body and breath begin to close out what came before. For the next hour and forty-five minutes, let those other things wait for you outside the door.

Track your sensations: head, shoulders, spine, abdomen. Notice your breath—shallow or deep? Rapid or slow? Are you hungry? Full?

Feel your sit bones on the chair, sensing gravity and the support beneath you. Feel your legs and your feet connecting down to the Earth.

And now: notice what emotions might be here.

All are welcome—irritability, joy, anger, restlessness, nervousness, confusion. Just notice.

Like our somatic body, we’re not trying to change anything. We’re just witnessing, compassionately.

**Gina Gratza:**
With your next breath, begin to bring your awareness back into the space around you. Sense your chair again. If your eyes were closed, softly open them. Let your eyes find something nearby that makes you smile—even if it’s just a subtle smile. Let your gaze settle there as you readjust to this moment.

Now, in the chat box, write what you’re noticing in your body or your emotions.

I’ll start: I’m quite sweaty. I have some lower back pain. And I feel joyful and excitatory—that’s a word!

Go ahead and share what you’re noticing.
