### Nervous System and Psychedelics

**Gina Gratza:** 
Thank you all for sharing in the chat—presence, gratitude, sore, calm, full tummy, little sleepy... That’s beautiful awareness. I appreciate the way you're articulating and tracking what’s happening in your body. It reminds us that what we see on the outside—in these little Zoom boxes—isn’t always the whole story.

So take care of yourself throughout today’s conversation. If anything agitates your nervous system or makes you sleepy, get water, take a bathroom break, stand up, shake it out, move your body, yawn. Do what you need to do. You can always catch the recording later. If you can stay present, beautiful.

Before we deepen into how we connect emotionally and energetically, it helps to understand the *science of connection*.

The nervous system is our body’s messaging system. It allows the body and brain to talk to one another.

This might be familiar to many of you—or new to some. Repetition helps us learn. If you've heard this before, maybe today it lands differently.

So:  
- The *brain and spinal cord* make up the central nervous system.  

**Gina Gratza:**
- The *nerves* are like tiny roads that carry messages throughout our body.  
- The nervous system helps us move, feel temperature, pain, and sensations.  
- It also regulates breathing, digestion, our heartbeat, and reactions to danger or safety.

It’s our body’s communication network: brain to body, body to brain.

There are two main branches:  
1. *Central Nervous System (CNS):* Brain (control center) + spinal cord (highway for messages)  
2. *Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):* Nerves branching from the spine to limbs, skin, organs—carrying messages back and forth.

**Gina Gratza:**
There are also two *types of functions* in the nervous system:  
- *Somatic (Voluntary):* The “doing” part—talking, moving hands, walking.  
- *Autonomic (Involuntary):* The automatic part—heartbeat, digestion, breathing.

And within the autonomic system, we have:  
- *Sympathetic:* Fight-or-flight responses—danger, stress.  
- *Parasympathetic:* Rest-and-digest—calm, recovery, safety.

So as we talk about psilocybin and the nervous system, remember what Tal taught you about *polyvagal theory* (Stephen Porges) and the *vagus nerve*—how it plays a huge role in social connection and safety. That’s all very relevant here.
