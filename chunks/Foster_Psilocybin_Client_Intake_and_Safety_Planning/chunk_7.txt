### Example of Low-Risk Case

**Jason Foster:**
A client is:
- Seeing a therapist for an *adjustment disorder* (a mild, situational mental health diagnosis).
- Has no medical red flags.
- Appears emotionally and psychologically stable.

In this case, even if they answered “yes” to question 3B, you may choose *not* to require formal clearance—though it may still be helpful for them to talk to their therapist.

> With their consent, you can even speak with the therapist directly.
