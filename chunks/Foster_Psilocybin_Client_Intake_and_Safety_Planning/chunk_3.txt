### Introduction to the Intake Process

**Jason Foster:**
Hi. I'm going to talk about an important part of the preparation process—doing a client intake using the long intake form. I recommend downloading the form and at least skimming through it before watching this video.

I'll discuss the purpose of the form and the review process with the client during intake. We'll also cover the different sections of the form, how to handle the information gathered, and how to create a safety plan with the client, if necessary.

### Preparing for the Intake

**Jason Foster:**
Review the form on your own before the intake session. As you do:
- Take notes on what answers you want to inquire further into.
- Flag any responses that might indicate a potential contraindication or safety concern.

Some of the factors we’ll talk about may indicate contraindications. For example, just because someone had a psychotic break five years ago doesn't necessarily mean services are contraindicated—but it does mean that a more careful assessment is needed. In many cases, making that assessment is outside the scope of your practice.

You can raise a flag, but it may be necessary to bring in another professional.

Note any confusing information or unfamiliar mental or physical conditions and consult before the in-person intake interview. You don't have to do this work in a vacuum—lean on the support system available to you.

### Beginning the Intake Session

**Jason Foster:**
After reviewing the form (possibly with consultation), you’ll meet with the client. Start with a welcome conversation. This begins the process of setting the container.

Building the relationship during this first preparation session is important. The strength of that relationship can become a resource during difficult moments in the psychedelic session. Establishing trust early on will also support co-regulation and facilitate deeper, more challenging conversations in preparation.

Once you and the client are ready, move into reviewing the long-form intake together.

Let the client know:

- You'll be going through some of the questions together.
- Difficult feelings or memories may come up.
- You'll support them by helping regulate their nervous system (e.g., slowing down, inviting them to breathe).

**Jason Foster:**
- They can choose not to answer any question.

Assume everyone has trauma. That’s okay—as long as you’re equipped with some basic skills, which we’ll teach in this training.
