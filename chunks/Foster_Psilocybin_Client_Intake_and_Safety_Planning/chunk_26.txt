### Personal Considerations: Diet, Sleep, and Sexuality
**Jason Foster:**

*Dietary Restrictions*
- Useful for planning *post-session snacks*.
- May reveal *disordered eating*, which is often linked to *underlying trauma*.
- If disordered eating is present, *consult with a specialist* experienced in this work—it can be delicate.

*Sleep Patterns*
- May reveal:
  - *Hypomania* or *mania* if they aren’t sleeping much.
  - *Insomnia*, which can indicate trauma.
  - General clues about *physical and mental health*.

*Sexuality and Sexual Trauma*
- May indicate whether the client’s *sexual expression* is marginalized.

**Jason Foster:**
- Important to assess *sexual trauma history*:
  - If you're the same gender as the abuser, *projection* may arise during session.
  - If you don’t have experience working with sexual trauma, *refer out*.

> Reminder: Many people do not remember or label sexual trauma as trauma. You are not there to convince them of anything.

### Support Conversations

**Jason Foster:**
> Ask:  
> “What do you think it would be like for you if an experience of trauma comes up during the session?”

Use this moment to:
- Normalize that old material may surface.
- Assess if they’re open to working with it.
- Explore possible *support strategies*.

### Integration Support

**Jason Foster:**
Questions begin to explore:
- *Social support system* for integration.
- *Personal practices* that may support their process.

> This can be a good time to *start the integration conversation* or you may choose to do it later during orientation.
