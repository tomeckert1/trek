### Past Psychedelic Use

**Jason Foster:**
As you review the client’s history with psychedelics or altered states, look for:

*1. Past Difficult Experiences*
Ask:
- “What caused the difficulty?”
  - A harmful facilitator?
  - Too high a dose in a party setting?
  - Was it challenging inner material?

> Sometimes clients may say something like:  
> “The facilitator tried to induct me into a cult.”  
> This may or may not be accurate—it could be projection.  
> You might ask:  
> “What did they say or do that gave you that impression?”

This can help you discern the situation without invalidating their experience.

*2. Unresolved Content*
Ask:
- “Is there anything that still feels unresolved or like it wants attention?”
- “Are you still trying to make sense of something from a previous journey?”

*3. Signs of Psychological Contraindications*
Does the client:
- Struggle to trust people?
- Exhibit rigid or suspicious thought patterns?

You aren’t diagnosing, but you *may need to consult* if something seems off.
