### Psychiatric Medications and Pharmaceutical Considerations

**Jason Foster:**
When it comes to medications, you’ll want to gather detailed information about:
- *What they’re taking*
- *Why they’re taking it*
- *How long they’ve been on it*
- *Any past attempts to discontinue use*

This helps you assess potential risks, underlying conditions, and readiness.

*Example: Medications and Diagnosis Overlap*
- A medication prescribed for *schizophrenia* might also be used for *OCD*.
- The reason for the prescription matters — it might point to deeper psychological conditions.

*Discontinuation: Proceed with Caution*

You are *not* a prescriber. But you can support the client in *discussing tapering* with their medical provider.

*Ask:*
- Why did they start taking the medication?
- What was happening in their life at the time?
- Was there trauma, loss, or a major disruption?

*Consider:*
- Some clients started meds after a *psychotic break* or *manic episode*.
- Their medication may be the *only thing keeping symptoms at bay*.

*Important Risks of Discontinuation*
- *Xanax* (and similar drugs) can be *dangerous to discontinue*.
- Symptoms may include:

**Jason Foster:**
  - Dizziness
  - Sickness
  - Worsened depression or anxiety
  - Risk of *psychosis* or *mania*

*Supporting the Process*

- Work *in collaboration* with prescribers and therapists.
- Some clients might need *a year or more* to discontinue meds safely.
- Clients may cancel their session once they understand the difficulty of getting off their meds.

*Ask reflective questions:*
- What is your goal around this medication?
- Is that realistic?
- Have you tried stopping before? How did it go?
- What would you need to try again safely?
- What are the risks and benefits?

### Honest Conversations

Clients may be *devastated* if they can't proceed with psilocybin immediately.
> You’re not here to gatekeep.  
> You’re here to support safe, appropriate healing.  
> Sometimes that means *saying no* — or *not yet*.
