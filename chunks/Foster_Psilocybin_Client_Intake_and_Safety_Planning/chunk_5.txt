### Medical and Mental Health Issues in Screening

**Jason Foster:**
Understanding how to approach medical and mental health concerns is one of the most challenging aspects of screening.

If you feel overwhelmed, remember:
- You can and often must refer the client to another professional.
- You don’t have to make these decisions alone.

Encourage honesty. Clients withholding important information can put both of you at risk.

### Documentation

**Jason Foster:**
Take notes during the intake:
- Notes help you track the client’s responses.
- They may also protect you if the client later takes legal action after a difficult experience.

### Specific OHA Guidelines

**Jason Foster:**
Question 3B on the OHA client intake form asks:

> “Are you currently being treated by a medical, clinical, or other healthcare provider for a medical, mental health, or behavioral health condition?”

OHA states that:

- If the client answers “yes,” facilitators *must* encourage them to consult with a healthcare provider about the risks of psilocybin.

That’s the *minimum* requirement. You’re allowed—and sometimes obligated—to take a stronger stance:
- You can *require* that the client get medical clearance before proceeding.

Many clients will understand and comply. If they don’t or can’t, you can—and should—say:

> “I am not comfortable proceeding until you get this checked out, for the sake of both your safety and mine.”

Standing in your authority on this issue is crucial.

### Why it Matters

**Jason Foster:**
Do you want to be responsible if a client has a psychotic break or a heart attack in the middle of a session? Emergencies happen. Screening and safety planning help reduce the risk.
