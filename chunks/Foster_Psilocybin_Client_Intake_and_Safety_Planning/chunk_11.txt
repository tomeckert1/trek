### Medical Conditions

**Jason Foster:**
Now let's go through some common medical conditions. This is *not a comprehensive list*, but it offers a sense of what's typically contraindicated and what’s not.

*Important Note:*
> *When in doubt, consult a medical professional.*  
> You are not a prescriber. You cannot give medical advice.

You can inform clients:
> “Microdosing is available through the service center. You might consider if that’s a good fit.”  
Be careful not to suggest it will definitively help.

*Epilepsy*
- *No clinical research* exists on psilocybin + epilepsy.
- Anecdotally, some say it may be okay *after 3 years* without a seizure.
- *Always consult* a medical professional.

*Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)*
- Similar guidelines: wait 3 years post-symptom or seizure (if medicated).
- Psilocybin is believed to be *neurogenerative*, which some find promising.
- Again, *anecdotal only*, not yet supported by clinical research.

*Pregnancy*
- Allowed under *OHA rules* if a safety plan is in place.
- Must involve the client’s doctor.
- Clients should *research risks and benefits* on their own.
