### Family and Relationships

**Jason Foster:**
*Assessing Relational Environment*

This section explores the client’s *personal life*, including:

*Abusive Relationships*

> *Definition:* Abuse is a pattern of coercive behaviors used to control a current or former partner.

- Can be emotional, physical, financial, sexual.
- Often escalates over time.
- Includes threats, intimidation, and isolation.

> *Facilitator’s stance:* It is unsafe to work with a client currently living with an abusive partner.

*Action:*
Refer to domestic violence resources. Service centers should have these on hand.

> Clients need a *safe space to return to* after their session to properly integrate.

*Conflict and Safety at Home*

Explore:
- “Are you living with conflict?”
- “What do you think it will be like to go home after the session?”

They may be able to *stay elsewhere temporarily*, but that may not be enough.

> One night away from an abuser is not integration.  
> A safe, stable environment is essential.

### Housing and Basic Needs

**Jason Foster:**
Unhoused clients:
- May not have a *stable environment* to return to.
- May have *unmet needs* at the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy.
- This can limit access to higher-order healing.

### Transitional Life Events

**Jason Foster:**
Not all instability is a contraindication.

Examples:
- *Lost job:* Could be destabilizing, or a relief.
- *Divorce:* May be grounding or completely unmooring.

Ask:
- How have they *processed* the transition?
- Do they feel *emotionally and financially stable*?

### Social Support

**Jason Foster:**
Explore:
- Number and quality of *friendships*.
- Do they have *solid relationships*?

Answers may:
- Reveal *unhealed wounds*.
- Offer insight into client’s *support network*.
