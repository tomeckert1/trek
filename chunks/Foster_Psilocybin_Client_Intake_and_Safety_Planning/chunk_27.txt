### Medical Accommodations and Safety Planning

**Jason Foster:**
*Medical Language & Additional Support*
- Most questions in this section are *self-explanatory*.
- Important notes:
  - *You cannot administer medications* or *operate medical devices* under your facilitator license.
  - *Written plans* are required for some accommodations.
  - Questions may indicate the *need for another support person*.

> Familiarize yourself with the *OHA rules* related to accommodations. These are found in the *Client Information Form* provided on Moodle.

### Writing a Safety Plan

**Jason Foster:**
Once you’ve completed the intake form review:
- You can begin writing a *safety plan*—either in the first session or after consultation.
- Safety planning includes:
  - Referrals to mental health or medical professionals.
  - Medication tapering assistance (under professional guidance).
  - Assessing the client’s *emotional support network*.

### OHA Rules for Safety Plans

**Jason Foster:**
> *From the OHA:*

- If a client and facilitator agree that a safety and support plan is appropriate after reviewing the intake form:
  - They must *collaborate* to draft a plan that:
    - Identifies specific *risks and challenges*.
    - Considers *available resources* (e.g., support network, professionals).

- Plans are *not required* for every client.

- *Safety plans may not be changed during an administration session.*
