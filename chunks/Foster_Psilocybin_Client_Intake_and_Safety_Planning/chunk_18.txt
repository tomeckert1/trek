### Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)

**Jason Foster:**
- Clients with true NPD are unlikely to seek help *for their narcissism*.
- They may be seeking support for:
  - Divorce
  - Job loss
  - Other life events

> Insights may occur, but often *don’t stick*.

*You can choose not to continue working with them.*

*Other Considerations:*
- May benefit more from *years of therapy*.
- If domineering, controlling, or excessively demanding — you can decline to work with them.
- Psychedelics may *exacerbate narcissism* in some cases.

> “Narcissism is a defense against not being a person.”

If you *can build rapport*, it’s possible to support healing — but requires high skill and experience.
