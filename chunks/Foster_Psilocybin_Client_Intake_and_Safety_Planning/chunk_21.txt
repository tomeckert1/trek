### Family History & the ACEs Test

**Jason Foster:**
*Childhood History*

Prompt:  
> “Did anyone in your immediate family experience major mental or physical health crises, trauma, or extreme stress while you were growing up?”
- This can give insight into *childhood wounds* and *unmetabolized material*.
- Use follow-up questions:
  - “What was that like for you?”
  - “What do you remember?”
  - “What’s it like to talk about that now?”

This may reveal *material seeking healing*, relevant to *psilocybin intention*.

*ACEs Test*

The *Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)* test:
- Can help assess *degree of trauma*.
- High scores = more likely trauma is present.
- Consider *inviting the client to take it* (link provided in training).

> Clients may begin to view their childhood differently after taking the ACEs test.
