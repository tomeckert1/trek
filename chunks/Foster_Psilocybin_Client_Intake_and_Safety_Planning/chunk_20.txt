### Trauma

**Jason Foster:**
- Dissociation may signal trauma.
- Ask for *headlines*, not stories.
- Avoid pushing for detail unless necessary.

*Example Prompts:*
- “Is there anything you’d like to tell me about that?”
- “Just give me the headline.”

**Jason Foster:**
Be mindful of *client intention* and *readiness*.  
They may not *identify experiences as trauma*, or they may have *repressed memories*.

*Working with Trauma as a New Facilitator*

- Clients with *significant trauma* should be:
  - Working with a therapist
  - Cleared by that therapist
  - Possibly doing *extended prep*

Also use trauma questions to understand their *healing process*:

> “What did you try before? What worked? What didn’t?”

Explore gently. Avoid blaming or accusing resistance.

> *Honoring resistance* is part of the work.
