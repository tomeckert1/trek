### Instability: Suicidality, Dissociation, and Trauma

**Jason Foster:**
*Suicidality & Violence*
- Any *history of suicidality or violence* should be assessed by a *mental health professional*.
- *Past* suicidality may not be disqualifying.
- *Recent* or *active* suicidality is likely contraindicated.

*Questions to Assess Risk:*
- Is it a passing thought?
- Do they fantasize about it regularly?
- Have they made a plan?
- Do they have the means?
- Have they made recent attempts?

> *Low-level ideation* may be safe.  
> *Active planning or recent attempts* are not.

Always *consult with a professional*, and if cleared, *collaborate on a plan*.

### Dissociation

**Jason Foster:**
*Screening Questions:*
- Memory loss?
- Feeling detached from emotions or self?
- Feeling like the world isnâ€™t real?
- Feeling like a different identity or age?

These may point to *extreme dissociation* or *Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)*.
> Most people dissociate to some degree.  
> *Extreme dissociation* may be a symptom of *underlying trauma* and be *contraindicated*.

Working with *DID*:
- Possible, but requires *specialized training*.
- *Extensive preparation* needed.
