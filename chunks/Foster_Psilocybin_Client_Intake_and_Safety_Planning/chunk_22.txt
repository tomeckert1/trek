### Psychedelic Tourists & Denial of Wounds

**Jason Foster:**
- Many clients sense that there is *something in them that needs healing*.
- Some psychedelic tourists or “pollinators” may *lack awareness* of these unhealed parts.

Ask:  
> “What do you think it would be like for you if an old memory came up during your session?”

If their response is dismissive (e.g., “That won’t happen,” or “I’ve already healed that”), inform them:

> “We don’t know what will arise in a session, and it could come up.”

If they *cannot accept that*, you may decide *not to proceed*.
