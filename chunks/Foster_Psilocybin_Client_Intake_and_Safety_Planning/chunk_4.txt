**Jason Foster:**
- Quietness
- Glazed eyes
- Excessive agreeableness

You may also feel it in yourself—getting spacey or forgetting what you're saying could mean your nervous system is resonating with theirs.

*Check-ins and Regulation*
Regularly check in with the client:
- “How is it to talk about this?”
- If they are dissociating, they may not be able to report their state clearly.

You might need to tap the brakes:
- “I’m wondering if this is too much for you to talk about right now. Let’s pause.”
- “Is it okay to continue?”
- “Do you want to keep talking about this or should we back off?”
- “Let’s take a breath together.”
