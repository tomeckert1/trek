### Psychosis and Schizophrenia

**Jason Foster:**
- Do not work with people who are on the *edge of psychosis*.
- Signs might include *confusion*, *difficulty focusing*.
  - Could be *ADHD* or early signs of *psychosis* — screen carefully.

*Past Psychotic Episodes*
- Refer to a *psychiatrist*, preferably one who understands psychedelics.
- If they’re medicated, that may be the only thing keeping them stable.

> Ask:
> - Do they want to stay on medication and risk a *blunted* experience?
> - Do they want to taper for a *stronger* experience?
> Require medical clearance either way.

*Rule of Thumb*:  
Avoid working with someone who has had a psychotic break in the last *five years*, unless they’ve had significant therapy and demonstrate stability.

### Schizoaffective Disorder

**Jason Foster:**
- Presents with a *fragmented sense of self*.
- Avoid further “blow open” with psilocybin.
- Work only if the diagnosis is *historical*, and the client is:
  - Thoroughly screened
  - Demonstrably grounded

### Paranoia and Distrust

**Jason Foster:**
- May reveal *undiagnosed schizophrenia* or *paranoid personality disorder*.
- Ask clarifying questions.
- Refer out if distrust seems excessive or out of the norm.

> Paranoia can be *amplified* by psilocybin — proceed with caution.
