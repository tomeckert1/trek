### Substance Use and Behavioral Considerations

**Jason Foster:**
When reviewing the substance use section, we’re looking for:
- *Problematic substance use* (modern, less-shaming term for addiction)
- *Physiological or psychological sensitivities*
- *Underlying mental health conditions*
- *Caffeine or stimulant-related issues*

*Problematic Substance Use*
This may point to:
- Underlying *trauma*
- *Mental illness* such as bipolar disorder

If use is *current*, assess:
- *Safety*
- *Willingness to pause or stop*
- *Withdrawal risks*

*Specific Substances*
*Nicotine*
- Not a major concern.
- Some clients may request to smoke during a session.
- Plan for this *ahead of time*.
- Recommend *avoiding smoking* the day of the session, especially after:
  - It may *shut down emotional processing*.
  - Encourage staying open to feelings.

**Jason Foster:**
*Alcohol*
- Clarify what “one drink” means — a beer? A heavy cocktail?
- Watch for signs of *dependency*:
  - Can they go a day without withdrawal?
  - Withdrawal *during* a session can be disruptive or dangerous.
- Encourage abstaining for *at least three days* prior.
- Note: *Self-medication* often reveals deeper material once substance use stops.
> Let clients know a mild hangover can negatively impact the journey.  
> Set your own boundaries around flexibility.

*Caffeine*
- Increases blood pressure and heart rate.
- May contribute to *overstimulation*.
- Recommend *reducing caffeine* day-of — but avoid withdrawal symptoms.
> Consider a gentle taper in the week before.  
> Ask if they’d like to work through withdrawal symptoms ahead of time.

*Heroin / Fentanyl*
- Most heroin now contains *fentanyl*, which has a *longer half-life*.
- Requires *extra caution* and likely *medical consultation*.

*Cannabis*

**Jason Foster:**
- Chronic use often indicates *self-medication*.
- Overuse can lead to:
  - *Emotional bypassing*
  - Downregulation of *cannabinoid receptors*
  - Reduced mood regulation without cannabis

> Chronic users may struggle more to self-soothe.  
> Ask them to take a *24–72 hour break*, if possible.
- Cannabis is stored in fat for *2–3 months*.
- *Longer abstinence* may bring up unresolved material.
> Clarify: Does the client want to confront what arises when off cannabis?  
> Your flexibility here is part of your scope and your discernment.
