### Intake Form Overview

**Jason Foster:**
This form is recommended but *modifications are allowed*. Versions may differ across Oregon, but most contain these sections:

1. *Goals and Purpose*
2. *Psychedelic Use History*
3. *Substance Use*
4. *Mental Health*
5. *Medical Conditions and Medications*
6. *Family and Relationships*
7. *Personal Information*
8. *Miscellaneous*

### Goals and Purpose

**Jason Foster:**
Start by asking:
> “What are your goals, hopes, or expectations for this work?”

Even if they answered it on the form, re-asking can reveal:
- Motivation
- Readiness
- Misconceptions

*Common Reasons People Seek Psilocybin*
- Addressing mental health issues
- Healing trauma
- Spiritual development or mystical experience
- Boosting creativity
- Grief and end-of-life work
- General curiosity

Ask clarifying questions and begin to manage expectations.

*Be Aware of the Client’s Lens*
Clients might come in seeking:
> “Union with the Divine”

But they may also carry:
- Difficult childhood experiences
- Unacknowledged trauma

Prepare them:
- They may *not* have a mystical experience.
- Painful memories may arise instead.
- That could still lead to deep healing.

> You’re helping them prepare for the *full range* of possible outcomes.

This is where it’s important to *hold both*:
- The *spiritual/transpersonal* perspective
- The *clinical/psychological* perspective
