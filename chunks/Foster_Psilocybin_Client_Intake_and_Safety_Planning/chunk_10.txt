### Context of Past Use

**Jason Foster:**
If they report having had amazing experiences at:
- *Parties*
- *Outdoor nature settings*

Remind them:
> “That context may have provided distractions. This will be different.”

*Past Experience ≠ Readiness*
- Even 20 Ayahuasca ceremonies or 500 LSD trips doesn’t guarantee they’ll do well with mushrooms in a *therapeutic* setting.
- Clients may react *very differently* in this context.

### Green Flags to Look For

**Jason Foster:**
- Past psychedelic use was *intentional*
- Sessions were followed by *integration work*
- Emotional material has already been *processed*
- They’re open and honest about difficult experiences

But remember:
> One green flag does *not* eliminate red flags elsewhere.

This section is just one piece of the overall picture of *goodness-of-fit*.
