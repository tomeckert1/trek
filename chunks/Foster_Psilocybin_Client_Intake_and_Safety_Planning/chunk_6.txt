### Example Scenario: SSRIs and Cardiac Risk

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s take an example:
- A client has been on an SSRI for five years.
- There is an indication on the form of an undiagnosed cardiac condition.

You can require that they consult both:
- Their *prescribing doctor*
- Their *general practitioner*

On the other hand, *not every client* who’s currently in treatment requires a formal safety plan.
