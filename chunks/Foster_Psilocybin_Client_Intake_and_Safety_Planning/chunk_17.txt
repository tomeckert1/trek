### Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

**Jason Foster:**
- *Complex diagnosis* — not covered fully here.
- If you’re a *new facilitator* with *no BPD experience*, do *not work* with these clients.

> They may seek to *punish you* for failing them.

- Psychedelics *can* help, but require:
  - Extensive preparation
  - Strong therapeutic relationship
  - Specialized training

*BPD Traits May Include:*
- History of firing therapists
- High-conflict relationships
- Explosive rage followed by collapse

*Note*: BPD may overlap with *complex PTSD*. Clients may not always know or disclose a diagnosis.
