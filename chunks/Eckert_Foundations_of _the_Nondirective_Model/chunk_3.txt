### Tom's Background and Personal Motivation

**Tom Eckert:**  
I grew up in Michigan and went to the University of Michigan. After college, I went straight to grad school in a clinical psychology program. I was still pretty young and idealistic.

I think I wanted psychology to be more about human potential and consciousness. But what I got was more clinical — more about pathology than potential.

This was back in the 1990s, and you could feel the field becoming increasingly subordinate to pharmaceutical interests. It was becoming more of an adjunct to medication management and psychiatry, which honestly left me disillusioned.

I felt like something was missing — the center was missing. My real interest was in humanistic thought, existential philosophy, Jungian psychology — the deeper stuff.

But I felt the field was losing its artistry, its depth — and most importantly, it was losing the human being at the center of it all.
Fast forward, and I can draw a straight line from that disillusionment I felt in school all the way to my motivation — with Sheri — to initiate the Psilocybin Services Act, Measure 109 in Oregon. That initiative, with the help of psilocybin, sought to put the human being and the human spirit back at the center of the mental health narrative.

So, the ideas I want to share tonight are about putting our clients — the actual human beings — back at the center of things, especially in the context of this tremendously powerful psychedelic work we’re privileged to do together.
