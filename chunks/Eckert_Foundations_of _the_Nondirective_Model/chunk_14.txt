### Recognizing Signs of Growth

**Tom Eckert:**
Let’s say you’re doing this work well — you’re showing up with authenticity, attunement, acceptance, and presence. What kinds of signs might you see in your client that suggest growth is unfolding?

Carl Rogers observed several common traits in people who are growing and healing. Here are a few to be aware of:

*Openness to Experience*
Clients may begin to open up more deeply, creatively exploring new perspectives. You’ll see them let go of rigid defenses and become more available to their feelings — the full spectrum, not just the easy ones.

*Trust in One’s Own Inner Experience*
You might notice clients beginning to trust themselves more — their emotions, their somatic signals, their intuitions. They become more embodied, more connected to their felt sense.

*Internal Locus of Control*
Clients may shift from externalizing responsibility to recognizing their own freedom. They begin to make choices from within rather than being driven by external pressures or expectations.

*Willingness to Be a Process*
They begin to understand themselves not as fixed entities, but as evolving beings — always in process. This brings with it a kind of freedom and humility, and a curiosity about what’s unfolding.

### Becoming Fully Oneself

**Tom Eckert:**  
These signs — openness, trust in one’s organism, a sense of authorship, and a willingness to be a process — all point to a person becoming more fully themselves.

Carl Rogers says it best:

> “It seems that gradually, painfully, the individual explores what is behind the masks  
> he presents to the world and even behind the masks with which he has been deceiving himself.  
> Deeply and often vividly, he experiences the various elements of himself  
> which have been hidden within.  
> Thus, to an increasing degree, he becomes himself.  
> Not a facade of conformity to others, nor a cynical denial of all feeling,  
> nor a front of intellectual rationality —  
> but a living, breathing, feeling, fluctuating process.  
> In short, he becomes a person.”

This is what we’re supporting. We’re not directing the change. We’re not fixing anyone. We are creating the conditions for someone to become more deeply and freely themselves.

And that’s what this work is all about.
