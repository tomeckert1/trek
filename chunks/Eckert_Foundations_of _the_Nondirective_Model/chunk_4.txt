### What Is the Nondirective Approach?

**Tom Eckert:**
Let’s get into the topic of the nondirective approach to facilitation.

A good starting point is to look at the language that tends to constellate around nondirective versus directive approaches.

Here are some terms that come to mind.

*Nondirective language:*
- Attuning
- Accepting
- Deep listening
- Clarifying
- Reflecting
- Mirroring
- Affirming
- Authentic relating
- Respecting
- Space holding

*Directive language:*
- Structuring
- Evaluating
- Interpreting
- Diagnosing
- Prescribing
- Guiding
- Intervening
- Teaching
- Programming

So why is the nondirective approach so closely associated with psychedelic work?

I think one reason is harm reduction. This is kind of inverse logic: we might prefer a nondirective approach because being directive in a psychedelic context can be harmful.

Now, is that always the case? No.

Can directive psychedelic therapy or interventions be effective at times? Absolutely — in some cases.

So again, plenty of nuance here.

But we should understand first and foremost that our clients are in tremendously vulnerable and suggestible states while on psychedelics. Everything gets amplified.

Many relational ruptures in psychedelic work happen because facilitators — often with good intentions — push the limits of a nondirective approach. Sometimes it's due to immaturity or ego. Sometimes it's due to tradition, beliefs, and rigid ideas about what ceremony is "supposed to be."
