### Nondirective Facilitation of Meaning-Making
  
**Tom Eckert:**
Let’s move into meaning-making — a huge part of what we do as facilitators. But we don’t do it for our clients. We support them in discovering their own meaning.

Here’s a quote from Viktor Frankl:

> “In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning.”

That’s the power of integration. When we help clients connect their experiences to a broader narrative, it becomes meaningful. But again — we don’t introduce meaning. We support their discovery of it.

### 6. Self-Authorship Meditation

**Tom Eckert:**
Let me share a short exercise — or maybe a guided reflection — on self-authorship. You can close your eyes if you like or just follow along.

**Tom Eckert:**
> Imagine your life as a book.    
> This book begins at your birth.  
> You turn the pages — chapters of childhood, adolescence, adulthood.  
> Every page contains words: events, feelings, memories. The ink is emotional. The nervous system remembers.  
> You cannot erase what is written. You can only flip through the pages until you reach the present.  
> Now you’re here — the current moment — and you turn the page…  
> It’s blank.  
> All the pages ahead are blank.  
> You are holding the pen.  

**Tom Eckert:**
> You can’t start a new sentence completely disconnected from the past — it has to cohere with the last. But that’s the only rule.  
> You are free to shape what comes next.  
> Think any thought.  
> Feel any feeling.  
> Tell any story.  
> Now here’s the paradox: While you can’t change the past, what you write next will change what the past means.  
> The story you tell now reshapes the story that came before.  
> The meaning of the past is always evolving.  
> In this sense, meaning is not fixed — it is authored. 

**Tom Eckert:**
> The word “author” shares its root with “authentic.”  
> So we might say: The more you are aware of your freedom to author meaning, the more authentic your life becomes.  
> You are not free to avoid hardship, but you are free to choose how to respond.  
> And that response — that act of authorship — is the ground of your authenticity.

Thank you for letting me share that with you.
  
So when your clients come out of their journeys, they may be in this moment — realizing they are holding the pen.

And that can be disorienting or exhilarating or both.

Your job is to help them notice that moment — to reflect their insights, to affirm their freedom, to witness their authorship.

We’re not prescribing meaning. We’re holding the space where meaning can emerge.

That’s the magic.
