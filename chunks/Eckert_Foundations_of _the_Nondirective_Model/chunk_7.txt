## Existential Perspectives: Becoming Oneself

**Tom Eckert:**
Let’s bring in a few more voices to deepen our inquiry.

*Paul Tillich*, existential theologian, says:  
> “Man’s task is to become what he truly is.”

*Søren Kierkegaard*, 19th-century philosopher and forerunner of existential thought, says:  
> “The most common despair is to be in despair of not choosing or willing to be oneself.  
> On the other hand, to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair.”

**Tom Eckert:**  

These are powerful ideas.

At first glance, it might seem like they’re championing individualism — as if the goal is to focus only on the self. But that’s not quite it.

I think it’s more accurate to say that our experience is dualistic. We are both individuals and parts of something larger. We are inseparable from the whole.

So to “be that self which one truly is” may mean maturing beyond a purely individualistic lens and into fuller understandings of our humanness — including our interconnectedness.

Of course, in our work, we meet each client where they are. Their path of growth will depend on where they’re starting.
I share these quotes and ideas to help us set the table — to create a philosophical orientation to the psychedelic journey and to our work as facilitators.

The question becomes:  
> How do we best support someone in becoming the self they truly are?

### The Role of the Facilitator

**Tom Eckert:**
Well, one thing we can do is… provide the mushrooms. 

But beyond that, we can also offer a particular kind of relationship — one that supports unfolding, one that clients can use to grow into themselves.

That’s what we’re exploring together.

These quotes hint at a higher self or truer self. Psychedelics can offer glimpses of that.  But let’s be real — our clients don’t usually come in with such lofty intentions. Most come in struggling. They’re trying to get through daily life. They have real issues. They’re suffering.

So here’s the question I want to put to you as facilitators:

> What will you do when you’re face-to-face with a troubled, conflicted person who is seeking and expecting help from you?

I ask this to stir some anxiety — because that’s often what shows up. We may think, “I need to have the right answers,” like a medical provider would.

But that’s not our role.

**Tom Eckert:**
Many of the issues clients bring to psychedelic therapy are beyond the scope of even the most skilled therapists — which would be a problem if we were expected to treat them directly in a clinical sense.

But here’s the good news:  
The real therapeutic work happens between the client and the medicine.

Let me say that again:

> **The mushroom is the therapist — not you.**

Your client and the medicine are engaged in a self-directed healing process.

Your role is to set the relational container that supports that healing — one that unfolds organically.

You’re not there to guide or fix or interpret.  You’re there to stay attuned to the human being in front of you.

**Tom Eckert:**

And what they’re likely asking — under all the specifics — is something like:

> “Who am I really?”  
> “How can I become more myself?”

They may not say that directly. But that’s the underlying need.

And the truth is: **only the client** — a unique, complex human being — **can choose to walk that path of self-discovery**.

What we can do is create the conditions that support that exploration.

What we offer is a relationship.

A relationship they can use — along with the medicine — to come into a deeper, truer understanding of themselves.

We can facilitate.

And that’s what this training is all about.
