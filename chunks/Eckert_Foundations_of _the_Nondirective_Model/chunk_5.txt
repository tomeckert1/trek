### A Personal Story: Ceremony and Harm Potential

**Tom Eckert:**  
I think we need to have an open conversation about ceremony — its beauty, but also its potential for harm if not held thoughtfully.

Let me share a personal story.

I was recently invited to an indigenous ceremony while I was in Mexico. I won’t name the tribe — that’s not the point — but we were invited in and sat in a circle. Seats were assigned; the shaman was clearly in charge.

He was beautifully dressed in his regalia and decided how much medicine we would take — without any input from me.

I drank the medicine and began having a very large experience. A few hours later, while I was still really deep in it, an assistant approached me. He held a feathered stick — a kind of spiritual talking stick — and asked, quite nicely but somewhat insistently, for me to approach the fire and verbally “unburden” myself.


**Tom Eckert:**
And in that highly altered state, I just didn’t want to do it.

In fact, the imposition completely derailed my visionary state and replaced it with social anxiety — all of it amplified by the medicine.

Out of respect, I followed along. But I felt out of control, unable to form words, and confused as to why I was being asked to speak. I felt like a clumsy child.

I started off in the wrong direction around the circle — apparently there was a rule about which way to go. I was redirected. I stumbled. I felt everyone’s eyes on me.

I kneeled at the fire, took a breath to try and overcome my anxiety, and said something out loud. And I’ll admit, that moment of expression did feel good. It was a little unburdening.

So again, I’m not saying directive interventions in ceremony can't be effective. But I do want to shine a light on how easily harm can happen.


**Tom Eckert:**
I returned to my seat, still quite disoriented. I didn’t know where to place the stick — apparently, it had a very specific location beside the shaman. I was corrected again. I couldn’t process the instructions in my altered state and felt embarrassed and overwhelmed.

I was okay — nothing disastrous happened. But in another context, or with someone holding trauma, that could’ve caused real harm.

This was a very directive ceremony — more on the extreme end — compared to what we’re advocating for with nondirective facilitation.

### Nondirective Skills in Ceremonial Contexts

Ceremonies can retain a nondirective character. Nondirective skills are extremely important, even — and perhaps especially — in ceremonial contexts.

Whether you’re working in a regulated or unregulated frame, the Hippocratic principle of “do no harm” applies.
