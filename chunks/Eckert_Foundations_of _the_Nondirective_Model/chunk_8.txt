### Carl Rogers and the Nondirective Approach
  
**Tom Eckert:**
In the Western psychological tradition, this nondirective, humanistic approach traces back to **Carl Rogers**.

Rogers sought to dismantle the old power dynamics in therapy and place clients in charge of their own healing.

His philosophy continues to reverberate in the psychedelic space.

I’ll be quoting him a lot.

Here’s one to start:

> “It is possible to explain a person to himself, to prescribe steps which should lead him forward, to train him in knowledge about a more satisfying mode of life — but such methods are, in my experience, futile and inconsequential.
>
> If a person is to truly integrate a new set of ideas, he must be ready for them — which often means that he must come to those ideas on his own, after a long period of gradually letting down his defenses.”

Rogers observed that by offering a certain kind of relationship, his clients would naturally discover within themselves a capacity for growth and change.

So if we return to that anxiety-provoking question — what do you do when someone is sitting in front of you suffering?

**Tom Eckert:**

Rogers would say:

> Provide a relationship conducive to growth.

That’s what we’re really learning in this program.

How to create a psychological climate where clients can access their inner capacities to heal and grow.

A relationship where clients feel safe to explore their inner world.

Where they are accepted as they are — free to move in any direction.

Where they can feel safe and seen, so they can examine even their deepest fears and insecurities.

Now, keep in mind what psychedelics appear to do — according to Carhart-Harris, they **loosen prior beliefs** and allow for deep flexibility and self-exploration.

Notice how the **effects of the medicine** and the **qualities of the therapeutic relationship** work together symbiotically.

The relational container supports the client’s freedom to explore.

The medicine opens new inner territory to explore.

Together, they support self-discovery.

### Rogers on Freedom and Change

**Tom Eckert:**
Here’s another quote from Carl Rogers:

> “How does one use this freedom?
>
> It is my experience that one uses it to become more and more oneself.
>
> One begins to drop the false fronts, the masks, the roles with which one has faced life.
>
> One appears to be trying to discover something basic, something more truly oneself.”

So, as facilitators, what kind of relationship are we offering?

We don’t want to reduce it to a checklist — but there are some core characteristics that Rogers and others identify as essential.

Let’s take a look.

### Essential Characteristics of a Nondirective Facilitator

**Tom Eckert:**
*1. Acceptance and Unconditional Positive Regard*

Let’s start with acceptance and unconditional positive regard.

I love this quote from Rogers:

> “The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.”

And from Tara Brach:

> “A moment of radical acceptance is a moment of genuine freedom.”

Would anyone like to reflect on those?

**Natalie (Student):**  
Yes. What comes up for me is that every part of ourselves just wants to be seen. The energy of who we are — what we’re made of — wants to move. Acceptance allows those parts to be seen, and then they don’t have to scream for attention anymore. They can do what they were meant to do before they got stuck.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Beautiful. That resonates with me. Your true self wants to move and be expressed.

And fear is the enemy of freedom. When we feel fear, we may overcompensate or disappear entirely. But in acceptance, we find our creative self — and that process can start to flow, especially within the space of a relationship that allows for it.

Let’s keep going.

**Asher (Student):**  
This also reminds me that people don’t have to take a directive approach with themselves either. Radical acceptance allows for a loosening of the self-narrative. It creates spaciousness. Letting go of old narratives allows room for change.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Yes. That inward-directed voice — self-directiveness — can be softened. We can stop controlling ourselves into being someone we're not. Spaciousness allows something deeper to emerge.

**Tal (Co-Facilitator):**  
We’ve got a lot of hands raised. This sparked a lot of inspiration. Let's continue.

**Kathy (Student):**  
This reminds me of something from our in-person session. We talked about value misalignment with clients — like, what if someone says something that really challenges your values?

At the time I thought, "No problem, just do the inner work." But then things came up for me, and I realized I had more work to do. It's not easy to be radically accepting. It’s something I’m still working on.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Thank you for naming that so clearly. These are ideals — think of them as directions, not destinations.

And yes, psychedelics often spark this journey. We begin to open up to a new level of self-acceptance we didn’t know was possible. That sets us on a path. And as facilitators, we’re doing our own self-development work so we can hold that space for others.

**Marce (Student):**  
When we judge ourselves, it takes so much energy to hold onto those thoughts and feelings. If we accept ourselves, we can start actively listening — to others and to what's arising within us.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Yes — it connects back to presence and deep listening. These are interrelated ideas. And when we experience acceptance in relationship, that energy begins to flow. That’s what we’re trying to offer.

Let me read a couple comments from Slido.

**Slido Comment (Jessica):**  
“We will sacrifice our authenticity to meet attachment needs. Survival is tied to attachment. Acceptance helps us reorient back to authenticity.”

**Slido Comment (Jason):**  
“Acceptance means you’re no longer avoiding the issue. You’re actually facing it, being present with it.”

These are powerful reflections.

**Firoz (Student):**  
I love the paradox: when you accept yourself — which feels static — you suddenly want to change. You’re free. Acceptance brings stillness and creative momentum at the same time. That paradox is alive.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Yes — exactly. When we stop trying to be something we're not, something authentic emerges. It’s like loosening an internal grip. And psychedelics help us see that grip — often how we’ve tried to be someone based on conditioning or survival needs. When that melts away, we find a new way of relating to ourselves — even the way we interpret or speak to ourselves.
