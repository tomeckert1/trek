Acceptance allows choice to return.

*2. Genuineness, Authenticity, and Transparency*

Let’s talk about genuineness, authenticity, and transparency.

Clients can sense inauthenticity a mile away — especially in psychedelic sessions. Everything is amplified. They feel it in the room.

Bring your full presence. Prepare yourself beforehand. Be real.

Now, authenticity doesn’t mean blurting out your opinions. It doesn’t mean sharing your own story unless it truly serves the client. Ask yourself: Who is this for?

Authenticity in this context means being energetically present and sincere — attuning, not performing. That’s what our clients feel.

*3. Attunement to the Here and Now*

Attunement to the here and now is deeply connected to being nondirective.

Being present means letting go of the map. It’s less about planning, more about being with what’s unfolding.

In presence, there’s room for emergent meaning — something fresh, something alive. It’s felt in the moment. If your client is caught in a story about the past or future, you can gently invite them back:

> “What’s happening right now?”  
> “What are you feeling in your body right now?”

That’s not necessarily directive — it’s anchoring. It’s somatic support. It’s an invitation to return to the felt sense.

**Tal (Co-Facilitator):**  
There’s a question in Slido about this. Danny, would you like to ask your question?

**Danny (Student):**  
Yes. I was sitting for someone who asked me to support their high-dose journey. They wanted to go deep.

But during the journey, they just kept talking — about football, car washes, random things. I felt like they were avoiding the experience. I gently tried to bring them back to their intention, but it seemed to push them further away. So eventually I just let them talk, hoping they’d come back to the medicine. But they never really did.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Thanks for that example. That’s real.

So first — our relationship isn’t casual. We’re not just “shooting the shit.” We are a special container, not a casual conversation.

But sometimes, clients distract themselves. Your presence, your posture, your energy — that matters. If you’re fully attuned, they will feel it.

Reflecting what you’re observing can be powerful. For example:

> “I notice we’ve been in a lighter space. Is that where you want to be right now?”

That’s not forcing. That’s reflecting. That’s holding a mirror.

**Tal:**  
In preparation, I ask clients directly: “Would you like me to remind you of your intention during the session if it seems helpful?”

That’s consent.

I also tell them: “If I sense your attention is pulling away from your inner experience, I may gently invite you back. Would that be okay with you?”

Jason has a simple line I like:  
> “Is this how you want to spend your time right now?”

**Tom Eckert:**  
Yes, exactly. With that prior agreement, you're not stepping over a boundary. You're helping them find their own river again. Remember the metaphor: the flow comes from the client.

*The Client’s Inner Process Is the True Agent of Change*

Change comes through real experience — not just thoughts or ideas. Psychedelics create the space for real, embodied experience.

This isn’t cognitive. It’s visceral. It’s lived. It’s emotional.

So when your client is in something — let it unfold. Don’t interrupt. Support it. Be there with them.

And when the moment has passed, let’s talk about it. That’s what integration is for.
