### Closing Thoughts and Final Guidance

**Tom Eckert:**  
I want to leave you with some final thoughts — kind of like guideposts or reminders as you begin or deepen your work in this field. These aren’t rules, but reflections drawn from experience that may serve you well.

*Be Supportive*
Share positive thoughts and feelings with your clients — but don’t fake it. Find something genuine. Appreciate their courage. Let them know you’re present.

*If It’s Hard to Like Your Client...*
Change the way you take them in. When you find someone challenging, remember: you’re likely witnessing a battle-worn individual. Their defenses exist for a reason. Try to feel genuine empathy, not pity. Stay present.

*Get Shoulder to Shoulder*
Don’t get out in front. Get next to your client — emotionally, energetically, relationally. See what they see. Feel what they feel. Share their world.

> "Clients profit enormously from the experience of being fully seen and understood."

That’s your main task. And there is art in that. There is heart in that.

**Tom Eckert:**
*Be Here Now*

It's the authentic encounter in the present moment that leads to authentic healing. Try not to be in the past or future. Just be.

> "Let nothing human be alien to you."

Let your clients matter to you. Respect their full humanity — especially when it's messy, confusing, or different from your own. That’s where the work is.

*Close the Container*
Finally, remember to take care of yourself. If you give yourself fully in session, make space after to let it go. The energies of others aren’t yours to carry.  
Leave the work at work. Be with yourself. Ground, process, and recover.  

Self-care isn’t an extra; it’s a responsibility.

Thank you all for being here tonight. It’s a deep honor to share this orientation with you as we begin the program. I hope this gives us a shared language and philosophical framework for the journey ahead.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation together.
