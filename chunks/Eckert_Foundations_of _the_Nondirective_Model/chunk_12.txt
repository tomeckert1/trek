### Growth, Maturity, and the Natural Tendency to Evolve
  
**Tom Eckert:**
Let’s continue by talking about what change actually looks like. Especially in the context of psychedelic work, real change isn’t just a shift in cognition. It’s experiential.

> Real change requires real experience.

Psychedelics are powerful precisely because they create moments of felt experience — often deeply emotional, somatic, and existential. It’s not just insight; it’s embodied insight.

When someone has a breakthrough, it’s usually because something inside them felt different. The therapeutic agent is not your clever interpretation. It’s the moment-to-moment experience that becomes integrated into a new way of being.

### The Client's Natural Tendency to Grow

**Tom Eckert:**
Carl Rogers spoke beautifully to this. He said:

> “This tendency may become deeply buried under layer after layer of encrusted psychological defenses.  
> It may be hidden behind elaborate facades which deny its existence,  
> but it is my belief that it exists in every individual  
> and awaits only the proper conditions to be released and expressed.”

This is one of the great insights of humanistic psychology — that people are wired for growth. They just need the right conditions.

And as facilitators, we’re helping to create those conditions.
