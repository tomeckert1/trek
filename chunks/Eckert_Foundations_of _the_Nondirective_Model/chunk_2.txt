### Introduction

**Tal Sharabi:**  
So, Tom Eckert is a seasoned psychotherapist, a founder, and Executive Director of InnerTrek. He was the architect of Oregon's Measure 109 — you probably know that — and led the campaign to establish Oregon's statewide psilocybin services program.

He served as the chair of Oregon’s governor-appointed Psilocybin Advisory Board during its pivotal first year, and also established the Sheri Eckert Foundation, which is the leading philanthropic provider of access to psilocybin trainings and services across Oregon and beyond through scholarships and other support programs.

So, that’s our Tom. I’m going to pass it to you, Tom. I’ll be here by your side, enjoying the lecture and also helping us weave in our curiosities and our interests.

### Setting the Stage

**Tom Eckert:**  
Alright. I’m really excited to be here this evening — thank you, everyone.

My hope is to spend some time with you and really sink into this topic. I love talking about this — the topic we’re going to explore tonight. I want to position this talk as a kind of first step into the work of being a facilitator — how we might look at that role.

This isn’t really a technical presentation, but more of a broad, philosophical take. I hope it sets the table for the more technical work we’ll do together, while giving us a way to think about what we do as facilitators.

So tonight, I want to explore the foundations of a nondirective, client-centered, humanistic model of facilitation — “nondirective” for short. We'll look at why this orientation to the facilitator-client relationship is so well matched to psychedelic work.

With that intention, I've already revealed an opinion I hold strongly: that psychedelic work should retain a primarily nondirective character, based on what these medicines do, how we can minimize harm, maximize efficacy, and ensure that the space is ethically held.

That said, there are plenty of nuances and exceptions. Some situations may call for a more directive approach. But tonight, I just want to lay a foundation for the nondirective approach before we explore those nuances — which we’ll do throughout the program. Think of this as a foundational talk.

I do think this material is pretty essential to the work we do.

At the same time, I’m just one voice. This is just one class. I’ll present a set of ideas here, offered in my “native tongue,” if you will — which may not be yours. So take it in as best you can. It’s all good.

And with that, let me start by sharing a bit about myself and how this topic became important to me.
