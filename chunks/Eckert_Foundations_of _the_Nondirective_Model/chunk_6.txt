### The Second Rationale: Nondirectiveness Supports Self-Discovery

**Tom Eckert:**  
So we've talked about harm reduction as one compelling reason to hold a nondirective stance.

But it's not the only reason.

The other reason — perhaps the deeper one — is that the nondirective orientation supports the process of self-discovery. It aligns beautifully with the mechanisms of the medicine.

That’s where I’d like to spend the rest of our time tonight.

Before I go further, though — I’ve said a lot. Is anyone feeling anything come up around that? Any reason to pause for comments or questions before we continue?

**Tal:**  
We’ve got one question in Slido, but I think it’ll be better saved for later. But I wonder if you want to receive any comments now — we could take a couple with hand-raising.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Sure, if anyone has something they’d like to share, we have time for one or two people. There’s a "Raise Hand" button in the Reactions tab. Go ahead, Frank.

## On Directive Interventions for Safety

**Frank:**  
Thanks. Hey, Tom.  
You said directive interventions can be harmful — but can the opposite also be true? Like, aren’t there situations where not intervening might cause harm? Like when someone needs help for safety or grounding reasons?

**Tom Eckert:**  
Yes — exactly. Safety is the major exception. If there’s a safety issue in the room, we do become directive.

There are other possible reasons where directive interventions may help — and if you’re a skilled, attuned facilitator, there's space for that.

But what I’m wanting to establish here is a default orientation. That when we come into the room, our primary job is to help our clients become more fully themselves through their own agency.

And that means we support the self-directed process — even when it challenges us.

Thanks for that point, Frank.

### The Client–Medicine Relationship

**Mariam:**  
I was also thinking about the nondirective approach — and how it supports the relationship between the client and the medicine.

At first, I thought it was a new idea, but then I realized — that’s the second reason you’re about to talk about.

**Tom Eckert:**  
Exactly. That’s where we’re headed next.

So, to really understand why a deeply held nondirective approach supports psychedelic healing, I think we need to return to some of the essential questions Tal asked during our first intensive.

What is the essence of psychedelic therapy?  
What do these medicines really do?

There can be many answers — but let me share a few from leaders in the field to get us thinking.

**Tom Eckert:**
*Robin Carhart-Harris*, psychedelic neuroscientist, says:  
> "A core therapeutic property of psychedelics is their ability to relax the precision of prior beliefs, allowing for deep psychological flexibility and self-exploration."

*Gabor Maté*, physician and author, says:  
> "What psychedelics can do in the right context is momentarily loosen the rigid structures of our self-concept, allowing us to experience freedom from the roles we have been trapped in. It’s not about fixing anything. It’s about reconnecting with who you really are."

So what are we seeing here?

Freedom.  
Self-exploration.  
Reconnection with the true self.  
A kind of deconditioning — a loosening of rigid identities.

Let’s explore these ideas more as we go along and consider how we can hold space for this kind of unfolding — the kind that psychedelics seem to naturally potentiate.
