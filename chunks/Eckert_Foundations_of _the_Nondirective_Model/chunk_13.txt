### Characteristics of the Facilitative Relationship

**Tom Eckert:** 
So if we’re creating those conditions, what do they look like?

Here’s Rogers again:

> “If I can create a relationship characterized on my part by genuineness and transparency,  
> by warm acceptance of and liking for the other person as a separate individual,  
> by a sensitive ability to see their world as they see it…  
> then my clients will experience and understand aspects of themselves previously repressed,  
> and they will become more integrated, more able to function,  
> and become similar to the people they would like to be.”

That’s the goal: to help someone become the person they would like to be.

So let’s look again at the characteristics of a facilitative relationship:

- **Genuineness** — being transparent, real, present
- **Acceptance** — unconditional positive regard, liking your client as a separate person
- **Empathic understanding** — seeing the client’s world as they see it

These aren’t passive. They require engagement, presence, and heart.
