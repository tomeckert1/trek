### Evening After the Session

**Jason Foster:**
Encourage them to have a *gentle evening planned* after the session:
- A nourishing meal
- A hot bath
- Quiet activities: walking, reading, journaling, or a favorite TV show
- Avoid overstimulation or confrontation
- *Hydrate*

> Suggest they have a “cuddle buddy” or a calming presence available if helpful.

Some people find *bedtime tea* or natural sleep aids useful afterward.

### The Days Following: Support and Integration Needs

**Jason Foster:**
Let the client know:
- *Some people need more care* in the days after the session, especially if trauma arose.
- Ask:
  > “If surprising or intense material comes up, what support can you call on?”
- Suggest having a *therapy appointment already scheduled* post-session.
- Some clients may prefer to be *alone*, others may want someone present but *not talking too much*.

If they have a partner:
- Ask:
  > “How can you avoid conflict with your partner during this time?”
  > “Can you ask your partner in advance to be in a caregiving mode?”
