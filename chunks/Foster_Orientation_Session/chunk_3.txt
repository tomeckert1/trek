### Introduction to Orientation

**Jason Foster:**
Thanks for showing up tonight. In my previous videos, I talked about the preparation process—specifically the intake process. This next part is about *orientation*, and I’m going to share my screen here.

So, intake is where you've met with the client, gone over the information form, reviewed the client bill of rights and informed consent, and written up a safety plan if necessary. Now you're ready to move on to the orientation phase, which typically happens in a second meeting with the client.

I just want to reflect again on the *metaphor of the journey* that runs through the whole process: preparation, administration, and integration.

One of the benefits of this preparation process is that it helps clients slow down. It invites them to create space in their lives for a truly meaningful experience. It signals that this isn’t the McDonald's of psychedelic work—we’re not doing drive-thru transformation.

### Timing and Requirements

**Jason Foster:**
Per OHA rules, a facilitator must complete the preparation process with every client who will participate in an administration session at least *24 hours*, but no more than *90 days*, before the client’s first administration session.

I recommend holding the *first meeting about a month out* from the administration session. That gives the client ample time to prepare and reflect on what they’re stepping into.

Then, I suggest the *orientation meeting* happen about *2 to 7 days prior* to the session—close enough that it’s still fresh when they show up.

Also, just so you know, I’m sharing not only these slides but also a lot of what I’m saying is written out and available on *Moodle*. So you don’t need to take down every word—just keep that in mind as you're listening or taking notes.
