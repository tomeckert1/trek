### Navigational Tools and Orientation to the Experience

**Jason Foster:**
You’ll want to talk to your client about *how to navigate* the experience itself.

These tools and approaches help clients *relax into the journey* and *engage with what arises*.

*Allowing vs. Surrender*

We don’t know what will happen in the journey, but the *attitude of allowing* is usually helpful.
- I’ve been using the word *“allow”* more than “surrender” lately.
- “Surrender” can be *confusing* or *loaded* for some clients—some may hear it as submitting to the guide or losing control in a threatening way.
- “Allow” is gentler. It invites letting go, *loosening the grip*, and trusting the process.

You might say:

> “Let it take you where it will take you. Let it show you what it will show you.”

Let them know it’s okay to *resist*. Resistance is normal. You might invite them to *notice the impulse to resist*—get to know that part of themselves.

They can even *talk to that part*, ask it to step aside, or simply *accept* that resistance is part of their process.

*Metaphors*
- *Sailing metaphor*: Let the wind and currents move you. Take your hands off the rudder.
- *Leaves on a stream*: Let your thoughts float past without attaching to them.

*Physical Relaxation Techniques*
- *Breath*: Invite the client to notice how each exhale is a kind of letting go.
- You might even *practice* that with them before the session.

**Jason Foster:**
*Emotional and Cognitive Tools*
- *Gratitude*: If someone’s in a dark place, they can try shifting into gratitude—recalling what they’re thankful for.
- *Curiosity*: Be curious about what’s showing up. Turn toward what you’d usually turn away from.
- *Witnessing*: Encourage witnessing the experience—feelings, thoughts, memories—without judgment.

Let them know: *there is no wrong way to do this*, as long as they’re honoring the agreements.

*Music and External Support*
- Invite them to let the *music take them* on a journey.
- Ask if they’re okay with you reminding them of their *intention* if it seems like they’ve wandered far from it.
- *Micro-contract* with them on these points: “Is it okay if I offer reminders or guidance if I sense you might need it?”

These are tools—not rules.
