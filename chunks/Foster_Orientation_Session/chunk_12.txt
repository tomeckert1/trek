### Touch and Consent

**Jason Foster:**
Refer back to Emma’s talk on consent and touch. You’ll want to:
- Clarify *what forms of touch are allowed*.
- Explain how touch will be *offered*, how it can be *declined or revoked*.
- Get *written consent* for touch, as per OHA rules.

Examples:
- “I can offer a hand, a hug, or a stuffed animal—but I won’t hold you.”
- OHA allows:
  - Hugs
  - Hands on hands, feet, or shoulders  
  *That’s it.*

Discuss edge cases:
- What exactly constitutes a hug?
- Can someone lean into you? Sit beside you and hug?
- Can they lay on top of you and hug? *(Short answer: no. That’s likely to trigger trauma or be misinterpreted.)*

If you’re going to stretch the definition of a hug, get really *clear and detailed* in advance, and get it *in writing*.

Same goes for *touch initiated by the client*:
- Are you okay if they want to hold your hand?
- If they rest their hands on your knees or feet?
