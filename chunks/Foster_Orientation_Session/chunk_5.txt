### Why Intention Matters

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s talk more about *intention*. This is something you probably started exploring in the intake session, but you’ll want to revisit it here—see where they’re at with it.

Why is intention important?

- It plants a seed in the unconscious mind.
- It gives the conscious mind something to refer to during the journey.
- It helps guide their *attention*—both in preparation and during the experience.
- It gives us something to reflect on during integration.

If a client feels lost during the journey or forgets why they’re doing it, their intention can be something to *come back to*.

I like to use the *sailing metaphor*: intention is like a compass heading. It doesn’t guarantee a direct path—there might be wind or currents that blow them off course—but it points toward a direction. It allows for organic, non-linear movement from point A to point B.

I also tell clients: “You can put your intention out there and then let it go.” They don’t have to keep it at the front of their mind—their psyche is holding it. The mushrooms are receiving it. They can trust that.

And remember, intention informs everything—how they prepare, what conversations they’re having with support people, what they’re noticing about themselves in the lead-up.

**Jason Foster:**
*Intention vs. Expectation*

It’s important to distinguish *intention* from *expectation*. Intention is what you hope for, what you aim toward. Expectation is what you think will happen.

Help clients let go of expectations. Invite them into *beginner’s mind*. What you intend may not happen—and that’s okay. Intention can still be meaningful and supportive, even if the journey takes a different shape.

*Refining Intention*

In this orientation session, explore whether the client’s intention has shifted since you last met. Has it evolved? Clarified? Deepened?

You might ask:
- What’s behind the intention?
- Why do they want a mystical experience, for example?
- What would that mean to them?

Sometimes people come in with unfocused or vague intentions—and that might be okay. But most of the time, you’ll want to invite them to *get more specific*.

Some things to note:
- *“Surrender”* is not a particularly useful intention. It’s more of an *attitude*. It’s something everyone should be invited into, but it’s not specific or personal.
- If someone says, “I want healing,” ask: “What is it you want to heal?”
- If someone says, “I want to speak to the mushrooms” or “the spirit” or “my higher self,” you can work with that. Encourage them to frame intentions as personal invocations:

  > “May I know myself more deeply.”  
  > “Teach me to let go of anger.”  
  > “Help me find my voice.”  
  > “Remind me of who I am.”

**Jason Foster:**
These are beautiful, potent ways of communicating with something larger than the self.

Also, remember: the *unconscious mind speaks in symbols*. It doesn’t process negations well. So instead of saying “I want to feel less sad,” help them reframe it:

- “I want to feel more joy.”
- “I want to find greater love for myself.”
- “I want to release what no longer serves me.”

Rather than naming what they want *less* of, ask them: “If you were healed, what would you be feeling instead?”

Sometimes clients will say, “I want to understand the blocks to my growth.” That’s fine—but why not *shoot for the moon* and ask to have those blocks removed, or integrated into wholeness?

This is the kind of conversation you can have in refining their intention.
