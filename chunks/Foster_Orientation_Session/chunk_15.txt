### Emergency Planning

**Jason Foster:**
- Talk about what happens *if there’s an emergency*, like a fire or medical event.
- Let them know:
  > “I’ll keep track of time. If you find yourself wondering what time it is, I’ll invite you to let that question go.”
  > “If you ask, I won’t tell you immediately. I’ll suggest you sit with the not-knowing for a moment. But if you still want to know, I’ll tell you.”

### Special Needs or Rituals

**Jason Foster:**
- Talk about *any special needs* that came up in the intake form.
- Ask if they want to begin the journey with any *personal ritual*:
  - Lighting a candle
  - Being cleansed with sage
  - A prayer or intention-setting moment
- Don't assume. Always ask:
  > “Would you like me to offer a ritual, or would you prefer to lead something yourself—or do nothing at all?”

*Cautionary story*:

I had a friend who did a journey with someone in a new space. The decor was very “new age” and the client assumed my friend had set it up that way. As a result, he projected mistrust onto her during the session.  
So: *Be mindful of what’s in the space*. Let the client choose whether it aligns with them or not.

### Practical Preparation Guidelines

**Jason Foster:**
Let your client know:
- *Wear loose, comfortable clothing.*
- Ideally, *arrive with an empty stomach* — stop eating about *4 hours before* the session.
  - Exception: If medically necessary or helpful, a *light snack* like orange slices 2–3 hours prior is okay.
- Avoid *heavy meals* beforehand.
- *Caffeine:* Ideally none, or the minimal amount necessary to avoid a headache.
- Be *well-rested* and *take it easy the night before*.
