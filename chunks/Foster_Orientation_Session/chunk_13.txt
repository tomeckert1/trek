### Physical Positioning

**Jason Foster:**
- I invite clients to *lay down*, but they don’t have to.
- I might say: “Eye masks often help people go deeper, but they’re not required.”
- Some people like to *talk* even on a high dose. Let them know that’s okay, but that verbal connection may be difficult.

### Conversational Expectations

**Jason Foster:**
- I’ll say: “You don’t have to talk—but you’re welcome to if you want to.”
- On low doses, you might be able to engage more conversationally.
- Let them know you’ll *listen*, and may offer light guidance:
  - A suggestion to breathe
  - A cue to bring awareness to their body
- And you’ll clarify that they can *ignore your suggestions* if they want to.

### Note Taking and Recording

**Jason Foster:**
- Let clients know that you will take some notes.
- You can write down things they specifically ask you to write down.
- Let them know you probably won’t be able to create a full transcript.
- Suggest they consider making an *audio recording* of the session for their own use.

  > If a lot of trauma came up during the journey, you might suggest that they *not listen to the recording right away*.
