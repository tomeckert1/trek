### Consent and Boundaries

**Jason Foster:**
Remember Emma’s teaching about *hard vs. soft boundaries* in consent.
- You and the client should *agree* on a *target experience level* (1–5).
- Decide whether that level is a *hard boundary* (cannot exceed it) or a *soft boundary* (there’s some flexibility).

*Hard Boundaries*
If you agree on a hard boundary at level 3, for example, you *do not go above that*—no matter what the client says mid-journey.

Even if they say, “Give me more,” you stick to the pre-agreed boundary.

*Soft Boundaries*
With a soft boundary, you can check in at a predetermined time and decide together whether to go higher.

Set these expectations clearly before the session.
