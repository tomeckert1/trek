### Q&A Portion: Student Questions and Discussion

**Simon Yugler:**
Thanks, Jason. There are a few questions on Slido I’d like to highlight. Some I’ve answered already, but here are a few with nuance.

*Q: *How do we set intentions with clients who have religious trauma?*

**Elyse:** 
In my experience, people with religious trauma can have a lot of triggers around language — prayer, higher power, even “sanctuary.” How can we be sensitive?

**Jason Foster:**
Great question. I’d avoid spiritual language whenever possible with these clients. Say clearly:
> “I'm not here to tell you what to believe or how to think about these experiences.”

Let clients *choose the language*. Neutral framing helps.

**Simon Yugler:**
Yes — bring this up early in prep work. Understand the client's **current orientation**, and co-create the language they’re comfortable with.

*Q: Jason, you’ve mentioned not liking the word "surrender." Can you say more?*

**Jason Foster:**
Yeah. I’ve seen “surrender” confuse clients. Some hear it as “submit to the guide” or “submit to the medicine,” which can feel unsafe. Others are like:
> “What does surrender even mean? How do I do that?”

Instead, I use “allow.”
> “Allowing” implies softening your grip. That metaphor seems more accessible.

**Simon Yugler:**
*Q: *How do you address ability differences — like blindness, reduced mobility, or communication issues?*

**Jason Foster:**
That’s a really important question — and one I don’t feel fully qualified to answer. I think it falls under **safety planning**. We’ll cover this in more detail next session with **Seth and Erica**. Please hold the question for then.

**Simon Yugler:**
*Q: *Can you give examples of common vs. unrealistic intentions?*

**Jason Foster:**
Common intentions include:
- Healing trauma
- Addressing depression or anxiety
- Gaining clarity or direction in life

Unrealistic intentions are more like:
- "Attain enlightenment"
- "Be completely healed"
- "Fix everything in one session"

Those aren’t wrong — but if there’s *expectation* behind them, disappointment is likely.

**Simon Yugler:** 
Yeah. You’ll sometimes hear clients say:
> “I want to release all ancestral trauma, heal my childhood, find my ideal partner, launch my career, and find my missing cat — tonight.”

We need to help *contextualize* those hopes.

**Tom Eckert:** 
Especially in service centers, we’re seeing folks arrive as a kind of *last resort* — “nothing else worked, this is my last hope.” That’s okay, but *expectation shaping is key*. Healing may begin with this journey, but the *real work happens after* in integration.
