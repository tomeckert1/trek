### Agreements: Creating the Container

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s talk about *agreements*. These help create a *safe, structured space* for the journey—like building a soft but sturdy geodesic dome: strong enough to hold intensity, soft enough to fall against safely.

*General Framing*

I tell every client:

> “I make these agreements with everybody, not just you.”

That helps avoid any feelings of being singled out or judged. One client once told me that when I said, “We agree there will be no sexual contact,” she thought I was giving her a weird look—like it was specific to her. So I now emphasize this is *universal practice*.

*Core Agreements*
- *No sexual contact*.
- *Everyone keeps their clothes on*.
- *You agree to give me* your:
  - Car keys
  - Cell phone
  - Watch
  - Wallet  

  I’ll hold onto these until it’s safe for you to leave.

- If you want to communicate with someone during the journey:
  > “I can take notes for you, and you can give them the message later.”
- *You agree to stay in the room or bathroom area* while you’re deep in the experience—until I say it’s safe to leave.
- (Optional, depending on center policy): Near the end, you may be allowed to wander around the service center *property*, but *not leave* the center itself until I say it’s safe.
- *I’m in charge of safety*

  > “You can move around, but if I ask you to stop something, you agree to listen.”  
  This is to protect your body, my body, and the objects in the space.

- If I say the word *“safety”*, I want you to really try to come back to baseline awareness and follow my instructions.
