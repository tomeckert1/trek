### Dosing Conversation

**Jason Foster:**
Let’s talk about how to approach the dosing conversation during orientation.

We’re *not* going deep today into specific amounts or detailed dosing protocols—we’ll cover that later. This is about *how you talk to your client* about dosing.

*Factors to Consider*

There are many variables: personal physiology, psychological profile, intention, and readiness.

I use a *scale of 1 to 5* to describe the range of psilocybin experiences:
- *1 – Mild*: “I feel a little melty.”
- *3 – Medium*: “I’m softly crying because everything is beautiful and perfect.”
- *5 – Strong / Heroic*: “Holy sh*t, the universe is giving birth to itself in a holy fire of eternal ecstasy.”

Find your own way of describing this. You can talk about gram weights or milligrams if your client has context, but *many won’t*, so use caution. Thirty-five milligrams doesn’t mean much experientially to most people.

**Jason Foster:**
*Matching Dose to Intention and Safety*

Talk with your client about what experience they’re hoping for—and whether it aligns with what’s *safe* for them.

- If they want a mystical experience, a *5-level* dose might be appropriate—*if* they’re ready.
- If they want to work with depression, *level 3* might be more aligned.

**Jason Foster:**
You bring your expertise—and also your personal limits.

Look back at your *intake screening*:

- *Green flags* support higher dosing.
- *Red flags* indicate more caution.

You may need to say, “That’s not safe,” or “I’m not comfortable going that high with you right now.”

*Suggested Starting Points*

For most clients, especially psychedelic-naïve, I suggest starting at *level 1–2*, or *3* if they have good experience and strong green flags.

Green flags for new clients might include:

- Meditation or mindfulness practices
- Personal growth work
- Insight into their own inner world
- Minimal trauma or emotional instability
- Enthusiasm and a felt sense of readiness

Even at level 3, people can have *powerful and life-changing* experiences, including *transpersonal states*, without full ego dissolution.

In clinical trials, we’re seeing *25–35 mg* used, which often maps to that middle range.

And please: don’t treat a “heroic dose” as the *gold standard*. More is not always better—especially at the first session. I never give a level 5 dose unless I’ve already seen how a client handles altered states.

**Jason Foster:**
*Red Flags to Consider*

These aren’t automatic disqualifiers, but they’re reasons to *lower the dose*:
- Significant trauma
- Ongoing mental health challenges
- Fragile ego structure

And even if someone has had positive psychedelic experiences before, it doesn’t mean they’ll do well with mushrooms—or with you.

Projections can come up. A strong projection onto you could create risk if the dose is too high. Start small. Build trust—with you and with the medicine.

*Managing Client Expectations Around Dose*

Some clients will *really want a full dose*. Maybe they’ve read Michael Pollan or heard about it on a podcast. They’re excited. They want transformation. Maybe they’ve had experience before and “know what works for them.”

But you have to *navigate the tension* between:
- What they want
- What you feel is safe and appropriate

Others may have *no idea* what they want. They just know they want to “try mushrooms.” If they seem *very nervous*, you might start at level 1 or 2, even without contraindications.

Let them know they can treat this as an *introductory journey*. If it goes well, they can always come back and go deeper.
