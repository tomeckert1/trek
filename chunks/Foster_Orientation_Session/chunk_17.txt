### Discussing the Arc of the Day

**Jason Foster:**
Near the end of the final prep session, give them a sense of the *flow of the day*.

Let them know:
- When they arrive, you’ll check in and review agreements.
- You’ll offer the mushrooms (with any pre-discussed ritual).
- It will take time for the medicine to take effect and peak.
- You’ll be there to *support whatever happens*.
- After about 4–5 hours, they’ll begin to come down.
- You’ll offer *snacks*, and possibly *time alone*, unless they prefer you to stay.
- After ~7–8 hours, it will likely be safe to leave.
  > If someone is picking them up, it's best if they are *flexible* about exact timing.
