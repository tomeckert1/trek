### Setting Expectations

**Jason Foster:**
Let your clients know that we’re stepping into the *unknown*.

Psilocybin will interact with their psyche in a way that’s *unique to them*. There’s a wide range of possibilities, and we can’t predict exactly what will happen.
- It might be beautiful.
- It might be scary.
- It will likely change from moment to moment.

Let them know: *“I, as your facilitator, can’t control what happens—but I’ll be there to support you.”*

*Duration & Sensory Experience*

Set expectations around *timing and physical experience*:
- The psilocybin will usually take effect *10–60 minutes* after ingestion.
- The effects typically *build over 20–45 minutes* until they reach a *peak*, which lasts around *2.5 to 3.5 hours*.
- The *come-down* phase can last another *2–3 hours*.
- So overall, the journey may last *7–8 hours*, sometimes longer.

Let them know you’ll be there for the entire session, aside from the occasional bathroom break.

I personally like to *offer time alone* to clients after around *4.5 to 5 hours*—but only if they feel comfortable. That reflective space can be valuable. We’ll go more into how to assess that when we talk about administration.

**Jason Foster:**
Also, be clear: *once they take the medicine, the journey cannot be stopped*. Taking it is a commitment to the experience.

Let them know that it can be *difficult emotionally*, but that it is *physically safe*. Screening and preparation greatly reduce the risk of negative outcomes.

And again—*no guarantees*.

*Describe the Range of Experience*

Prepare them for the possible range of experiences. Here’s some language you can use or adapt to your style:

> “Psilocybin affects the body and mind in many ways. You might feel wonder, fear, anger, sadness, happiness, joy. Memories may arise—images from your past. For some, it feels like a dream. You might see with your mind’s eye, feel timelessness.”

More possibilities:
- You might feel deep peace or profound love.
- Or you might feel disoriented, unsure where or who you are.
- You might feel connected to nature, to all beings, or to deceased loved ones.
- You might relive your birth or become an animal.
- You may feel empathy, electricity in your body, shivers, yawning, or tears.
- Your pupils will dilate. Sensory perception will change—sounds, smells, visuals.

If you open your eyes:
- You might see breathing walls, geometric patterns, or vibrancy in nature.
- Light might be overwhelming.

On a physical level:

- Some feel like moving or releasing energy.
- Some feel nausea or vomit.
- Some sweat. Some stay still. Others move around a lot.

This can sound intense. *Watch how it’s landing for them.* Pause. Invite questions. Explore any fears that arise.

You’ll have to find your own language here—how to walk the line between *honest disclosure* and *not freaking them out*.
