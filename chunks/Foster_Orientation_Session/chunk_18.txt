### Scheduling Integration Sessions

**Jason Foster:**
Talk with the client about integration support:

- Schedule an integration session — ideally *two days after* the administration session.
  - Some facilitators prefer a next-day session or even immediately after.
  - *Make sure it’s scheduled* before the journey.
- Let them know:
  > “We’ll talk more in training about the timing and content of integration.”

> “Preparation is 25% of the work. The session itself is 25%. Integration is 50% — that’s where people really make changes in their lives.”

**Jason Foster:**
Integration can be:
- Short or long
- A few days, weeks, months, or even years
- A time to *reflect*, gain clarity, and *translate insights* into their lives

Most people benefit from at least one integration session. It provides closure and offers continued support.

Recommended:
- *Two integration meetings*
  - One soon after the journey
  - One within a month

If they work with a therapist or other support person, suggest they *make a plan to share their journey* with that person.
