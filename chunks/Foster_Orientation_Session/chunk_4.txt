### Initial Check-In with the Client

**Jason Foster:**
When you meet with the client for orientation, begin with a *check-in*:
- What’s come up for them since your last meeting?
- How are they feeling about taking psilocybin?
- How are they feeling about working with you?

Also check in on anything related to the *safety plan*. For example:

- What did their doctor say about tapering off medications?
- Do they need any additional medical support during the journey?

This is also a good time to revisit something you might have discussed at the end of the intake session. If your client has a therapist, you might ask if they’d like to *invite their therapist in for additional support*. Some therapists are open to this and may even work at a reduced rate, recognizing the value and opportunity to gain more experience in psychedelic care.

If they’re open to that, you can also check in directly with the therapist—just to have a conversation about how to best support the client, and if there’s anything important you should know.
