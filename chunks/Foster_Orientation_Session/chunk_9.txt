### Booster Doses

**Jason Foster:**
If the client’s experience is *underwhelming*, and they’re still within the boundaries, you can offer a *booster*.

Tell them you’ll *check in* and that they can ask for more if they feel the effects aren’t sufficient.

But again: *only give boosters to reach the agreed-upon experience level.*

We’ll cover more on *timing* and *how to assess whether a booster is needed* later.

And remember, the OHA has a *maximum limit*: 50 mg of psilocybin per session. That’s a hard legal cap.

### Methods of Ingestion

**Jason Foster:**
Let clients know that psilocybin can be offered as:
- Dried mushrooms (solid)
- Ground mushrooms mixed into a *smoothie with honey*
- *Tea* (steeped mushrooms)

*Lemon tekking is not allowed* under OHA rules, and we’ll explain why in a later session.

If a client is prone to *nausea*, you can discuss whether a smoothie might be easier than solids.

You’ll get more into *why* different forms of ingestion may be offered and how to adjust based on the client’s needs.
