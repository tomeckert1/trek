### Bathroom Protocol

**Jason Foster:**
- Let them know:
  > “I’ll help you to the bathroom, get you to the toilet, then I’ll wait outside.”
- Ask them *not to lock the bathroom door*.
- Let them know:
  > “If you’re in there a long time, I’ll check on you verbally.”

### Support During the Session

**Jason Foster:**
- You’ll get them *water* if needed.
- Let them know:
  > “It’s a good idea not to drink too much water, since that can increase nausea with mushrooms.”
- Reassure them:
  > “I’ll track how much water you’re drinking so you don’t have to worry about it.”
- You can gently remind them to *slow down* if needed.
- Let them know:
  > “If you want tissues, I’ll offer them.”

And here's a key point of etiquette:
> Don’t *push* tissues on someone who is crying.  
> Just make them available—offering a box gently, without implying they should stop crying.

### Bodily Fluids

**Jason Foster:**
- Let them know:
  > “If you need to vomit, I’ll offer you a bucket and help clean it up.”
  > “If you pee or poop your pants, I’ll help you get clean clothes and some washcloths.”
