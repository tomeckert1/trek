### Evidence of Information Flow Shifts

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- Under psychedelics, brain shows:
  - *Decreased top-down* (predictive) processing
  - *Increased bottom-up* (sensory/emotional) processing
- Suggests *emotional limbic systems* gain influence as higher-order control weakens

> “You see more influence from the emotional brain when the top-down grip loosens.”

### REBUS and Information Flow in the Brain

*REBUS Model Continued*
- “Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics” (REBUS) emphasizes how psychedelics:
  - Loosen rigid, top-down beliefs and predictions
  - Allow bottom-up data (e.g., emotions, sensations) to be more readily processed
- Supported by findings that under psychedelics:
  - *Top-down information flow is reduced*
  - *Bottom-up influence increases*

> “We shift from autocratic top-down systems to a more anarchic, egalitarian system.”
