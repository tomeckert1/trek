### LSD, Consciousness, and the Spectrum of Brain States

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Here’s another key finding: when comparing brain entropy across different substances and states:
- *LSD* produces a high entropy effect  
- *Ketamine* produces a smaller effect  
- States like sleep or anesthesia reduce entropy  
- Disorders of consciousness (e.g., coma) show even lower entropy

This positions psychedelics uniquely—they increase conscious richness rather than suppress it.

### Post-Trip Brain Changes: Snowfall and Smoothing
  
**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Now let’s shift to what happens *after* the psychedelic experience—when the trip is over and the “snow” settles.

We’ve looked at brains post-psychedelic and seen something exciting:  
- The *brain becomes more integrated*.  
- There’s a *decrease in modularity*—meaning the usual separation between brain systems (like the default mode network) becomes less rigid.  
- This “smoothing” of functional connections appears to *correlate with therapeutic benefit*.

In two separate depression studies, *the more the brain smoothed out post-trip, the better the participant was doing*.

Even in healthy volunteers, this effect predicted *improved well-being at one month*. So we have an acute brain effect (during the trip) leading to *long-term changes in mental health*.

### Modeling Psychopathology: Canalization and the Snow Globe

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Robin uses the metaphor of *a snow globe*:
- In depression or other mental illness, we see a *canalized* (entrenched) pattern—a deep groove or rut the brain is stuck in.
- Psychedelics *shake the snow globe*, disrupting entrenched patterns.
- As the snow settles, the brain *reorganizes in a more flexible and integrated way*.

He shows models of brain network communication with psilocybin, LSD, and DMT—all showing *increased between-network connectivity* and *diminished dominance of top-down systems* like the default mode network.

This may reflect *ego dissolution*—a loosening of hierarchical control—and a move into more exploratory or open mental states.

### A Note on Functional Anatomy and Lasting Changes

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
In a recent study still under review, Robin reports:
- Participants rated their first high-dose psilocybin trip as the *most unusual conscious state* of their lives.
- *Anatomical brain changes* were observed one month post-trip—specifically, changes in the brain's white matter (its structural “cabling”).

This finding, if confirmed, suggests that psychedelics don’t just change *function*, but can also change *brain anatomy* in meaningful ways.
