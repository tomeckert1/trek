### Emotional Breakthrough and Therapeutic Mechanisms

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
We now have predictive path models that look at the psychological components potentially driving therapeutic change. Yes, this comes from healthy volunteer studies, but it's very relevant to what’s happening in Oregon.

The most robust predictor of therapeutic response is *emotional breakthrough*—emotional release, catharsis—often seen as people crying and letting go during the experience. This is followed by *psychological insight* and then improvements in *well-being*.

This pathway—breakthrough → insight → well-being—is a strong and consistent finding.

### Therapeutic Rapport Matters

One of the most compelling findings is the role of *therapeutic rapport*. In one large study (published in the New England Journal of Medicine), rapport—measured with just a single item the morning of dosing—was more predictive of emotional breakthrough than anything else. It explained 67% of the variance in breakthrough scores.

So your connection with the guide or facilitator is crucial for enabling the kind of release that leads to therapeutic change.
