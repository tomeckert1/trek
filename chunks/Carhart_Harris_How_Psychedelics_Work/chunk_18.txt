### Brain Connectivity Changes: Acute vs. Afterglow

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
*Increased Communication During the Trip*
- Under psilocybin, brain systems *increase communication across networks*
- This has been seen consistently across:
  - Psilocybin
  - LSD
  - DMT

> “The communication between systems or between modules increases under a psychedelic.”

*Systems That Lose Influence*
- *High-level systems* like the *Default Mode Network* lose their dominance
- This may map onto *ego dissolution*

> “Rather than returning to the capital city of the brain, the Default Mode Network, you remain in the wilderness—searching, exploring.”
