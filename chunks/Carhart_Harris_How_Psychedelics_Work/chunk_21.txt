### Clinical Trial: Psilocybin vs. Escitalopram (Lexapro)

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
*Study Design*
- *Double-blind, randomized, two-arm trial*
- Compared:
  - Two high-dose psilocybin sessions (25mg, three weeks apart)
  - Daily escitalopram (Lexapro) for six weeks

*Primary Outcome Controversy*
- Trial missed its *primary outcome measure* (QIDS-SR-16), leading to misleading headlines
- However:
  - *95% of outcome measures favored psilocybin*
  - All other depression and well-being scales showed significant improvement for psilocybin

> “Had we chosen any other measure, the media would have exploded with headlines about how psilocybin outperforms Prozac.”

### Rapid and Sustained Improvement

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- *Well-being scores* were significantly higher for psilocybin at all measured timepoints
- Improvements were noticeable as early as *two weeks post-dose*
- Contrasts with slower onset of SSRIs (often 6–8 weeks)

### Qualitative Differences in Outcomes

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Psilocybin group reported higher improvements in:
- Ability to cry
- Compassion
- Intense emotions
- Creativity
- Pleasure
- Concentration

> “These subjective experiences of emotionality and creativity are unique to psilocybin.”

### Emotional Responsiveness in the Brain

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- *Escitalopram* reduced brain responsiveness to *all emotional stimuli*
  - Consistent with *emotional blunting*
- *Psilocybin* had minimal effect on emotional reactivity
  - If anything, increased responsiveness to *neutral faces*

> “Escitalopram muted emotional response; psilocybin did not. That’s important.”

### Long-Term Effects and Structural Brain Changes

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
*Subjective Reports on Psilocybin Intensity*
- Study with healthy volunteers receiving psilocybin for the first time
- All but one rated it as the *most unusual experience of their lives*

> “Every participant except one said it was the weirdest thing they had ever experienced.”

*Anatomical Brain Changes*
- Evidence of changes to *white matter tracts* (brain cabling) one month post-psilocybin
- Suggests that a *single high-dose session* may induce *lasting brain structure changes*
- Study currently under review for publication in *Nature Neuroscience*

> “It’s the brain physically changing after one dose of psilocybin.”
