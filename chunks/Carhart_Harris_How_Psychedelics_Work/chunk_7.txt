### Transdiagnostic Potential

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Another exciting possibility is that psilocybin therapy is *transdiagnostically effective*—it could work across a wide range of conditions:

- Depression  
- End-of-life anxiety  
- Addictions (nicotine, alcohol, possibly cocaine and methamphetamine)  
- OCD  
- Body dysmorphia  
- Anorexia (especially treatment-resistant cases)
- Chronic pain (e.g., fibromyalgia)

In the anorexia study, we saw strong responses, particularly at the three-month follow-up. That’s notable because anorexia is often hard to treat, especially in people in their 30s. To see 60% in remission after two to three high-dose sessions is very promising.

We’re also seeing a signal in fibromyalgia. The study’s small—20 patients, placebo-controlled—but so far, the outcomes are very encouraging. Better than what we saw in the depression data.

That *transdiagnostic effect* is going to continue to ruffle feathers. There’s healthy pushback right now—spotlights on safety, critiques of hype—but trial after trial continues to show promise.
