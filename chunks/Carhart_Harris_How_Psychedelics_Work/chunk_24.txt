### Revisiting Carl Jung

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Carl Jung said:
> “In all chaos, there is cosmos. In all disorder, a secret order.”
- Interpretation: While psychedelics increase neural entropy (disorder), *new forms of order* may emerge from previously repressed or hidden material
- Psychedelics allow access to *emotional and unconscious content* that can be integrated by higher-order systems once the trip resolves

### Implications for Therapy

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- The increase in emotional processing supports observed *emotional breakthroughs* during psychedelic sessions
- These breakthroughs often lead to:
  - Psychological insights
  - Therapeutic change
  - Enhanced well-being

> “You get the emotional release, and the high-level systems can still register that — it’s not like you’re asleep.”
