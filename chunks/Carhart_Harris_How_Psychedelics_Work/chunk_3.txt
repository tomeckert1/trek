### Introduction: Focus on Classic Psychedelics

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
So, you know, what I tend to do—and I’ve done it for a while—is focus on the classic psychedelics. You could say I do that because I think they're the most interesting, personally. That’s kind of the core business. If it wasn't for the classics, perhaps psychedelics wouldn’t captivate our imagination, change people, and inspire the zeitgeist in the way that they do.

The classics include good old psilocybin, LSD, DMT, and mescaline. These are all compounds that stimulate the serotonin system, specifically the serotonin 2A receptor.
