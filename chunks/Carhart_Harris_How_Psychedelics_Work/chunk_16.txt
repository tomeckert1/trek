### Long-Term Brain Changes After Psilocybin

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
*Subjective Impact*
- In a current study (under review), participants were asked to rank their *first-ever psilocybin experience*
- *All but one* said it was the *strangest and most unusual conscious state* of their life

*White Matter Changes*
- *Anatomical brain change* found *one month after* a single high-dose psilocybin session
- Change observed in *white matter cabling* (i.e., brain connectivity pathways)
- Study is under review at *Nature Neuroscience*

> “The brain physically changes after a single dose. That’s why this is such an exciting finding.”
