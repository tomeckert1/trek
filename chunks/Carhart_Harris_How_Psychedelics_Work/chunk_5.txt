### Beyond the Receptor: The Mind Makes the Brain Interesting

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**  
You know, the brain is only as interesting as the mind. And the inverse isn’t necessarily true. We’re fascinated by the brain because we know brain activity couples to subjective experience. If we didn’t know that, it’d just be a fancy-looking organ.

It’s the mind—its psychology, its subjectivity—that is our way in to finding the brain interesting. And if we treat these as equivalently important—as sort of isomorphic, to use a fancy term—we can’t just define how psychedelics work based on pharmacology. We have to go to the psychology. We have to honor it. We have to listen to it.

So that’s what I’m doing here. It’s a work in progress. And it’s remarkable, actually, that we don’t have a strong, compelling definition of what makes a substance psychedelic based on subjective effects—on phenomenology.

### Defining “Psychedelic”: A Missing Element

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
I’m working on that, because I think it’s a gap in the space. If we don’t address it, then people say things that are, in my view, contradictory—like, “these compounds can be psychedelics but not psychedelic.” That’s where the cheeky term “non-psychedelic psychedelics” came from.

So I’m developing a short subjective rating scale that I hope will be sensitive and specific to the action of classic psychedelics. It should show exclusivity for compounds like psilocybin and LSD, compared to near neighbors like MDMA and ketamine.

The hypothesis is that classic psychedelics are especially psychedelic. They especially reveal the psyche, perhaps the inner workings of the mind and brain—as implied by the etymology: “psyche” (soul) and “delic” (to reveal).
