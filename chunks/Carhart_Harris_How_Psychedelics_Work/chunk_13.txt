### Predictive Brain Models: REBUS and Relaxed Beliefs

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**  
This brings us to the REBUS model: “Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics.”

At the core of the REBUS hypothesis is the idea that the *brain is a prediction machine*.  
It constantly uses *top-down models*—beliefs, assumptions, expectations—to interpret sensory input.

Under psychedelics:
- These *top-down beliefs are relaxed*.
- The brain’s *predictive grip loosens*d, allowing for *greater bottom-up flow* (from sensory and emotional systems).

We see this empirically:
- In ordinary waking consciousness, brain activity is *dominated by top-down flow*.
- Under psychedelics, this pattern *flips*, and *bottom-up information becomes more dominant*.

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
This could explain phenomena like:
- Emotional release
- Increased suggestibility
- Enhanced access to unconscious material

Carl Jung again:  
> “In all chaos, there is cosmos; in all disorder, a secret order.”  
This speaks to the idea that when top-down control dissolves, *new insights and reorganizations can emerge*.

### Biological Evidence for REBUS

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Evidence supporting REBUS from brain imaging:
- Under psychedelics, *top-down directional information flow decreases*.
- Bottom-up influences increase—suggesting a *flattening of hierarchical control*.

This aligns with:
- *Emotional breakthroughs*
- Catharsis

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- Access to repressed memories

Emphasizes that this shift doesn’t mean consciousness is diminished—it’s not sleep or anesthesia.  
Rather, it’s a *rebalancing of brain hierarchy*, allowing deeper emotional and somatic content to surface.
