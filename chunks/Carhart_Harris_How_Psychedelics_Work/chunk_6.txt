### Recent Clinical Evidence: Rapid and Enduring Effects

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
I want to touch on some of the latest clinical evidence. I may be missing the most recent Usona study, but here are some takeaways.

All trials so far—without exception—have manipulated the set and setting. Whether it’s called “psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy” or “psychedelic therapy,” the principle is the same: it's not just about giving a drug. You're training to provide psilocybin in a safe and effective way, and that assumption is built into the entire field.

What’s remarkable is that assumption hasn’t been tested scientifically all that rigorously. Hopefully, in time, we’ll do those studies. Because if we don’t, people might think you can give psychedelics without therapy and still get the same effects. That may lead to mistakes.

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Another takeaway is that the improvements seen with psychedelic therapy are very rapid. In our first treatment-resistant depression trial, everyone showed some improvement after psilocybin therapy. And the effect endured—a relatively flat line out to five weeks, even three months.

That contrasts with something like ketamine infusion, where the effects tend to be short-lived and require repeat administration. With psilocybin, there seems to be a longer therapeutic tail.
