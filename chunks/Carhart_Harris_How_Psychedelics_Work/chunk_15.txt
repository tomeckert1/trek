### Emotional Blunting and Brain Reactivity

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**  
We examined *brain responsiveness to emotional stimuli* (faces with fear, happiness, or neutrality) using fMRI.

Findings:
- Lexapro *dampened* brain response to all emotional expressions
- Psilocybin *preserved or enhanced* response, particularly to *neutral expressions*
- Suggests Lexapro may *mute emotion*, while psilocybin *restores affective range*
