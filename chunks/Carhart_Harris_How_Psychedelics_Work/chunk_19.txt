### Long-Term Integration After the Trip

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
*Post-Session Brain Changes*
- After the “snow globe” of the trip is shaken, the snow settles
- *Brain becomes more integrated* in the days/weeks following psilocybin
- Metaphor: the *canalized “valleys” of depression* become *smoothed out*

*Decreased Modularity*
- Decreased *modularity* means less rigid separation between networks
- Greater integration correlates with *better mental health outcomes*
- Seen across two psilocybin depression trials and a healthy volunteer replication

> “The more modularity decreases, the better people are doing.”
