### Entropic Brain Hypothesis
  
**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let’s talk about a model that’s a bit dense but incredibly important: the *entropic brain hypothesis*. Simply put:
- *Entropy* = randomness or unpredictability in brain activity  
- *Low entropy* = predictable, rigid brain states (e.g. sleep, anesthesia)  
- *High entropy* = flexible, rich brain states (e.g. psychedelic experiences)

Psychedelics *increase brain entropy*, making activity more random and complex, which *correlates with heightened conscious experience*.

*DMT, Psilocybin, and Brain Entropy*
- We see that with intravenous DMT: as entropy increases, so does subjective experience.
- With a placebo dose of 1 mg psilocybin, no entropy increase is observed—verifying that it’s inactive.
- A full dose (~25 mg) causes a clear spike in entropy.

What's more fascinating is that *brain entropy during the session predicts outcomes weeks later*:
- More entropy → more psychological insight (next day)
- More insight → improved psychological well-being (1 month later)

This temporal chain—from minutes to a month—supports the idea that psychedelics induce neuroplastic shifts with lasting impact.

### Context Matters: Therapy and Set/Setting

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Important caveat: in these studies, *therapy and context are standardized and strong*. That’s not a variable. So while brain entropy predicts therapeutic outcomes, we can't say that giving psychedelics alone—without context—would do the same.

Without therapeutic containment, heightened entropy might lead to *challenging or chaotic experiences*, not healing. So the magic is not just in the drug—it’s in how the experience is held.
