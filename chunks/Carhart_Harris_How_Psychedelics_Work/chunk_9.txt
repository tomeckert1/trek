### Expectancy vs. Active Effects

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Here’s a fun and important finding: when comparing two groups—one receiving Lexapro (an SSRI) and the other psilocybin—we assessed treatment expectancy.

In the Lexapro group, *expectancy predicted the response*. The more people expected to get better, the better they did—suggesting a placebo-like effect.

In the psilocybin group, however, *expectancy did not predict outcome*. That’s key. It suggests that the therapeutic effects of psilocybin are not just a placebo response, but stem from something active in the treatment itself.

This addresses one of the criticisms often leveled at psychedelics: “maybe it’s all in people’s heads.” Well, yes—it is in their heads, but not in that way.
