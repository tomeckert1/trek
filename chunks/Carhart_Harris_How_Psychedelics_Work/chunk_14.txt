### Clinical Trials: Psilocybin vs. SSRIs (NEJM Trial)

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
Let’s talk about the *New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)* trial comparing *psilocybin therapy vs. escitalopram (Lexapro)* for major depressive disorder.

*Trial Design:*
- *Double-blind*, randomized, two-arm study
- *6 weeks* of daily Lexapro vs. *2 psilocybin sessions* (25mg, 3 weeks apart)
- Primary outcome: QIDS (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology)

*Key Results:*
- *95% of outcome measures* favored psilocybin over Lexapro
- BUT… psilocybin *missed the primary outcome* (QIDS) by a narrow margin
- This limited the strength of conclusions, due to pre-registered statistical protocol

*Nuance:*
- Other measures (HAM-D, BDI, PHQ-9, well-being scales) *significantly favored psilocybin*
- Faster onset of effect with psilocybin (clear improvement by week 2)
- Side effects like emotional blunting were more prevalent in the Lexapro group
- Psilocybin participants reported *increased ability to cry, feel compassion, and emotional depth*

> “Had we chosen any other measure as the primary outcome, the headlines would have read: *‘Mushrooms outperform Lexapro.’*”
