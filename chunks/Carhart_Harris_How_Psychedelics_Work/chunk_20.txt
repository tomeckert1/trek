### Metaphor Recap

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- Before: deeply grooved states (e.g., depression) that are hard to escape
- After psilocybin: smoother landscape, fewer “default ruts” for the mind to fall into
- Aligns with the *canalization model* of mental illness

> “You don't want to be depressed, but that’s where your mind is pulling you. Psilocybin flattens that attractor landscape.”
