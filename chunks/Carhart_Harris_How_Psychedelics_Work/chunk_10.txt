### Canalization Model: The Role of Habits

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
What is psilocybin actually treating?

I propose that many forms of psychopathology share a common feature: an *inability to change*, or what I call “canalization”—a progressive entrenchment of mental and behavioral habits.

This canalization model suggests that psychedelics promote *plasticity*, defined simply as the *ability to change*. If that’s the solution, then canalization—rigid, reinforced habits—is the problem.

You see this across:

- Depression  
- OCD  
- PTSD  
- Addictions  
- Eating disorders

And maybe even beyond pathology—political dogma, ideological rigidity. So in a way, psychedelics loosen the grip, making room for flexibility, reorganization, and transformation.
