### Visual Illusions & Predictive Brain Function

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- Demonstrates optical illusion showing *motion where none exists*
- Illustrates how the *brain is predictive*, often “filling in” gaps for efficiency
- This ties into the *REBUS model* (Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics)

### REBUS: Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- Under psychedelics, *predictive models (beliefs)* become less rigid
- There's a *de-weighting* of internal assumptions and prior beliefs
- Psychedelics may *relax top-down control* (e.g., Default Mode Network) allowing *bottom-up information* (e.g., limbic/emotional content) to emerge

> “Top-down constraints weaken; bottom-up information gains influence.”

### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Processing

**Robin Carhart-Harris:**
- In normal waking consciousness, *top-down influence* dominates
- Under psychedelics, *information flow flips* toward bottom-up
- This reversal supports *emotional release* and *psycho-emergent material*
- Matches the phenomenon of *ego dissolution* and emotional catharsis

> “It’s not that consciousness drops—rather, it’s redistributed. Emotional material rises, and high-level systems receive it.”
