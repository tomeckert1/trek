### Common Risks and Side Effects

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**

Let’s talk about the common risks we see with psilocybin:

- *Fear, panic, confusion:* Even with proper preparation and a strong therapeutic alliance, people can still freak out. Psilocybin opens access to non-ordinary states, which can feel overwhelming.
- *Potentially dangerous behavior:* People might thrash around, break things, or try to exit the space. I once had a client rush to the balcony and lean over the railing—not because he thought he could fly, but in a way that was still very concerning. So: monitor behavior closely, and make the trip space as safe and benign as possible.
- *Physiological effects:*
  - Moderate increase in *blood pressure* and *heart rate*
  - *Nausea*
  - *Dizziness*
  - *Dilated pupils*
  - *Headaches* (often the day after the session or as it's ending)

These are all fairly common.

### Rare but Serious Risks

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s look at some of the rare, but more serious risks:

- *HPPD (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder):*  
  This involves flashbacks or persistent visual distortions long after the trip ends. It's much more common with LSD than psilocybin and has only been documented in recreational use, but it's still worth noting.

- *Psychosis and Mania:*  
  Psilocybin disorganizes the brain — that’s part of its healing potential, but also why it can be dangerous for people prone to *psychotic* or *manic* states. These are already disorganized neurological conditions.

- *Seizures:*  
  Similar logic — psilocybin’s disorganizing effects can trigger a seizure in someone predisposed.

- *Increased suicidality:*  
  Yes, sometimes psilocybin can reduce suicidality, but there are rare instances in which it worsens. This makes screening and risk assessment essential.
