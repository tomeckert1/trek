### Blood Pressure and Psychedelics

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Psychedelics, including psilocybin, *moderately raise heart rate and blood pressure*. For most people, this is not a concern. But if a client is already in a risky range, adding psilocybin could be harmful.

*Blood Pressure Ranges and Contraindications*

If someone has *Stage 2 hypertension or higher*:
- *Top number (systolic) > 160*
- *Bottom number (diastolic) > 100*

> *That’s a no-fly zone. Do not proceed.*

Send them back to their care provider to get it under control before proceeding. You do *not* want to worry about stroke or heart attack during a session.

*Practical Guidance*
- Automated BP cuffs are okay but not super accurate—better than nothing.
- If the client is on BP meds, *check BP* or ask them to get a reading at a pharmacy.
- Ask them to report the reading back before proceeding.

*Remember:*
If you're not comfortable taking the reading yourself:
> “Pharmacies often have free BP machines. Can you check it and let me know what it was?”

This protects both *you* and *your client*.

*Prescriber Tips (for dual-role providers)*

If you're also a prescriber working in a different capacity:
- For BP > 150/90, consider intervening medically before proceeding with a session.
