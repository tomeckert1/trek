### Closing Reflections

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Key Guidelines:*
- Never advise clients to abruptly stop psychiatric meds
- Work with medical professionals for tapers
- Respect the power—and limitations—of psilocybin
- Avoid pill shaming; stay client-centered
- Psilocybin → psilocin → CNS binding
- Half-life ≈ 3 hours (clears in ~15 hours)
- Liver plays essential metabolic role

*Dosing Myth Busted:*
- *Body size ≠ dose requirement*

*Final Note:*
- Boosters are a flexible tool for navigating SSRI blunting
- Safety and client comfort always come first
