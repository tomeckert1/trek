### Fainting (Syncope) and Presyncope

**Dr. Zelfand:**
When someone feels faint or dizzy, it's often related to *low blood pressure* or *hypoglycemia*—especially if they’ve fasted before the session.

*Physiology*

In response to a trigger:
- *Heart rate slows*
- *Blood vessels dilate*
- *Blood pressure drops*
→ Reduced blood flow to the brain = lightheadedness or fainting

*Intervention Strategies*

1. *Lay the person on their back*
2. *Elevate their legs* above heart level:
   - Place feet on armrest, wall, or pillows
   - You can hold them up temporarily if needed

OR

- *Sit and lean forward* with *head between knees*

> This helps return blood to the brain.

*Clients with Chronic Low Blood Pressure*

- May have conditions like *Lyme disease* or *POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)*
- Consider *pre-loading with fluids* before the session
- Use positional interventions during the session if needed

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*If the Client Faints*

1. *Check breathing and pulse*
   - If present: wait for them to come to
   - Elevate legs
2. *Once awake:*
   - Move slowly
   - Offer electrolytes and a snack
   - Don’t let them stand too fast

> This *does happen*—we had a client faint on retreat.  
Laid her down, elevated legs with a chair, gave ginger candy + electrolytes. She was fine.

*When to Call 911*
- Client is *not breathing*
- Turns *blue*
- *No pulse*
- Doesn’t regain consciousness within *a couple of minutes*
- If the episode looks like a faint, but then transitions into *jerking or seizure-like activity*
→ This is not fainting. It’s a seizure.
→ *Call 911 immediately*
