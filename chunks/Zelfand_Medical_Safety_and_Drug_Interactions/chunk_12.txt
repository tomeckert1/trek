### Stroke Awareness and FAST Assessment

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Now I’m going to mention the very rare—and I hope none of you ever see it—*stroke*, also known as a *cerebrovascular accident (CVA)*.

*Two Types of Stroke*

1. *Ischemic Stroke*  
   - A blood clot blocks a vessel in the brain  
   - Oxygen can't get to critical areas  
   - Causes tissue damage

2. *Hemorrhagic Stroke*  
   - A blood vessel *ruptures*  
   - Blood leaks out instead of circulating  
   - Also results in brain damage

> You don’t need to know which type it is—*both are emergencies*.

*Time is Critical*

Every second counts. Whether it’s paralysis, brain damage, or death, *early intervention makes all the difference.*

### The FAST Acronym

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
> A stroke screen you should memorize and practice.
- *F – Face:*  
  Ask them to smile.  
  - Smile should be *symmetrical*  
  - If one side droops = emergency  
  - (Unless they’ve disclosed Bell’s palsy or prior facial paralysis)

- *A – Arms:*  
  Ask them to *raise both arms* above their head  
  - Both arms should rise *evenly* and stay up  
  - Drooping = red flag

- *S – Speech:*  
  Ask them to *say a sentence*  
  - Should be *coherent* and *not slurred*  
  - If unsure, say:  
    > “I’m sorry to interrupt your process. I just need a safety check. Can you say a sentence in English?”

- *T – Time:*  
  - Even *one* abnormal sign = *call 911 immediately*  
  - Seconds and minutes matter  
  - Don’t wait to see if it gets better

> “If it’s not a stroke, you still did the right thing by calling 911.”

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Practice Exercise*

We did a quick breakout exercise:
- Partner up in pairs
- One plays facilitator, the other the client
- Facilitator runs through FAST assessment
- Then switch roles

> The goal is to develop *muscle memory* so you can act quickly under stress.
