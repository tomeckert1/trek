### Additional Questions from Students

**student:**
What if EMTs say you can’t come along in the ambulance?

**student:**
(ER experience)
- They likely *won’t let you ride in the ambulance*, but you can *meet them at the hospital*.
- Once at the hospital, the person will eventually be *left alone*—someone should be there for them.

> “The hospital staff will appreciate your presence and information. You’ll be welcomed if you’re helpful and informed.”

### Recognizing a Seizure vs. Trauma Release

**Dr. Zelfand:**
People may *shake or tremble* during a session—that’s often *a healthy trauma release*.

But a *seizure* looks different:
- *Not rhythmic*
- *Loss of consciousness*
- Client *cannot respond* or follow commands

> “It’s a burst of uncontrolled electrical activity between brain cells.”

### Facilitator Protocol for Seizures

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Do not* hold them down.
- *Do not* put fingers or spoons in their mouth.
- *Do* ensure they won’t *injure themselves* (e.g., place a pillow under their head).
- *Stay with them* to monitor breathing and prevent choking or suffocation.

**When to call 911:**
Immediately, if it's a clear seizure.

### HPPD – Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- Rare, but *real*.
- Clients *re-experience visuals* from the trip days, months, or years later.
- Occurs mostly with *recreational use*, not in therapeutic settings.

**When to call 911:**
> “If someone says, ‘I had visuals last night, but they passed’—that’s not HPPD. HPPD is chronic and disruptive.”
