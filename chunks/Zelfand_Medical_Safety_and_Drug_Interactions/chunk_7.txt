### Oregon Health Authority Contraindications

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
OHA currently lists *three absolute contraindications*:
1. *Active suicidal ideation*
2. *Use of lithium (within the last 30 days)*
3. *History of psychosis*

And I get it — it’s tough, because psilocybin can help people who are suicidal. But it can also push someone deeper into crisis. For now, *active suicidality is a no-fly zone*.

### Common Medical Situations

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)*

This one happens a lot and often goes unrecognized.

Symptoms may include:
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Confusion
- Irritability
- Weakness
- Anxiety

This can happen especially if people fast before the session and then go 4–8 hours without food. That’s a long time.

*What to do:*
Offer snacks! Nothing fancy—a little fruit, crackers, applesauce. A variety of textures and flavors is helpful.  
Also, ask during intake:  
> “How do you feel when you skip a meal?”  
> “Have you ever been told you have hypoglycemia?”

*Headaches*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Headaches are *very common*, especially:
- At the end of a session
- The day after
- Hydration (water + electrolytes)
- A cool washcloth on the forehead or back of neck
- Shade and cooling the space
- Blood pressure check (if a cuff is available)

Whatever the client typically uses for headaches usually works: ibuprofen, magnesium, electrolytes, etc.
