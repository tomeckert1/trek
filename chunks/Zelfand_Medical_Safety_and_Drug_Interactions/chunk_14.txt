### Q&A: Multiple-Day Psilocybin Use

**Student:**
_Is there risk in taking psilocybin multiple days in a row? Like at a retreat center?_

Not necessarily, especially if the person is *medically stable*. But some risks to keep in mind:
- If the person has *high blood pressure*, repeated sessions can keep *spiking* it
- That repeated stress can be dangerous

### Student Story: Blood Pressure Cuff Experience

**Belle:**
At a past intensive, Erica needed a volunteer for a *blood pressure test*.
- Belle volunteered and got *alarming readings* using automated cuffs
- Manual cuff readings showed normal pressure
- Automated cuffs can be inaccurate for some people  
- *Know your baseline* using both types  
- If you get suspicious readings, *verify manually*

### Do Service Centers Have On-Site Medical Staff?

**Erica Zelfand**
Some do, some don’t. For example:
- *InnerTrek* has *Seth*, a medical professional on staff, but not always *on-site*
- You should know who your emergency medical *contacts* are and how to reach them

### Can Non-Medical Facilitators Take Blood Pressure?

**Tal:**
Are we allowed to take blood pressure as non-medical professionals?

**Dr. Zelfand:**
Yes, you can *take a reading*, but:
- You *cannot* diagnose or prescribe
- You *can* use that reading to decide whether or not to *proceed* with a session

> “You're deciding whether or not to proceed with an activity—not treating a condition.”

This helps *reduce liability* and protect your client’s safety.

### Screening Without Diagnosing

**Jason:**
This relates to a broader issue of *scope of practice*. As facilitators, we can:
- *Screen* for safety
- *Observe* what’s happening
- Use those observations to decide whether to proceed

We *cannot*:

**Jason:**
- Diagnose
- Prescribe
- Intervene medically
