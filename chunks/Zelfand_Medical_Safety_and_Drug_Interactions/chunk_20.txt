### Psilocybin Metabolism and Elimination

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Oral Ingestion Pathway:*
1. *Mouth:* Mushrooms are chewed and swallowed
2. *Stomach:* Hydrochloric acid breaks down mushroom material and begins releasing psilocybin
3. *Small Intestine → Liver:*
   - Enzyme alkaline phosphatase converts psilocybin into *psilocin*
4. *Brain:*

*Oral Ingestion Pathway:*
   - Psilocin (lipophilic) crosses the blood-brain barrier
   - Binds to *5-HT2A serotonin receptors* → initiates psychedelic experience

### Half-Life of Psilocybin

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Half-life ≈ 3 hours*
- General rule: Multiply half-life by *5* to estimate full clearance
- → Psilocybin fully clears the system in *~15 hours*

### Body Weight and Dosage

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Body size does NOT predict psychedelic response*
- Large-bodied individuals may not need a higher dose
- Dosage should be based on *sensitivity, not size*

### Role of the Liver

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- The *liver* plays a key role in breaking down psilocybin

*Oral Ingestion Pathway:*
- Important to assess *liver health* during intake screening
  - Ask about *alcohol use*, *street drug use*, or known *liver conditions*
