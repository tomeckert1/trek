### Suggested Equipment for Service Centers

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
You don't have to be a medical provider to use basic tools:

1. *Sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff):*  
   - Especially useful if clients are on blood pressure meds  
   - Do not blindly trust self-reports like "my BP is under control"
   
2. *Pulse oximeter:*  
   - Measures pulse and oxygen saturation  
   - Pulse reading is the main interest here

> Never take a client’s word alone for key medical info. Always verify blood pressure and oxygenation if there's any question.  
> _Also, don’t assume someone has a doctor just because they take medications._
