### Public Service Announcement: Tapering Medications

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Do NOT Suggest Clients Abruptly Stop Psychiatric Medications*
- *Benzodiazepines* (e.g., Xanax, Valium, Ativan)  
  → Abrupt discontinuation can lead to *life-threatening seizures* and *long-lasting CNS damage*  
  → Requires *slow, supervised taper* under medical care
- *SSRIs / Antidepressants*  
  → Sudden withdrawal can lead to *brain zaps*, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, and destabilization  
  → Taper should take *months*, not weeks

> "Going off a medication is a destabilizing event. Taking a psychedelic is a destabilizing event. If you do the two too close together, that double punch can push someone into crisis."

### OHA Lithium Policy

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Lithium = No Fly Zone*
- Anyone who has taken lithium in the last *30 days* is *not eligible* for psilocybin services

*Lithium lowers seizure threshold and can interact dangerously with psilocybin
