### Recognizing a Heart Attack

**Dr. Zelfand:**
A heart attack, or *myocardial infarction (MI)*, can be difficult to distinguish from normal psychedelic side effects—because the symptoms overlap.

*General Signs*
- Rapid breathing  
- Discomfort  
- Sweating  
- Anxiety  

> These are also common in the psychedelic state.

*For Individuals Assigned Male at Birth (AMAB)*
- Tightness or pain in the chest (like someone is *squeezing their chest*)  
- *Severe* chest pain  
- This is a *heart attack until proven otherwise*  
→ *Call 911*

*For Individuals Assigned Female at Birth (AFAB)*

Heart attacks can look different:
- Sensation in the throat, like a pill is stuck
- Pain in:
  - Left shoulder
  - Shoulder blade
  - Elbow

These signs are often missed, leading to higher lethality in women.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Differential: Panic Attack vs. Heart Attack*

If you're unsure:
1. Try calming the person for 1–2 minutes.
2. If they say, “It feels like someone is squeezing my chest”—  
→ *That’s not a panic attack. That’s a heart attack. Call 911.*

*Supportive Measures*
- Slow, deep breaths, with an emphasis on the *long exhale*
- Reorient through senses:
  - Smell (e.g., essential oils)
  - Touch (blanket, plant, ice cube)
  - Sight (name 5 things that are red)
  - Hearing (name 3 sounds)
  - Body awareness (wiggle toes, feel feet on ground)
- Snacks and water (address potential hypoglycemia or dehydration)

*Reassurance Script*

> “You're safe. You took psilocybin. You're in a service center. What you're feeling is the drug. Everything is okay.”

Sometimes people forget they took a substance—gently remind them.
