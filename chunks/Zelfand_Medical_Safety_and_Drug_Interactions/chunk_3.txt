### Introduction

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Tonight we're going to talk about medical situations and drug-drug interactions in the context of psilocybin facilitation.

As a facilitator, particularly in the state of Oregon, you're not expected to be trained in CPR or as a first responder. You're also not expected to be a pharmacologist. Nevertheless, it's important to have certain situations on your radar so that you can distinguish between what’s truly an emergency and what just looks scary.

When you know what's actually an emergency, then you know when it's time to stop hesitating and call 911, get backup, and minimize harm to individuals during their experience.

We’ll talk about:
- The risks of using psilocybin
- Common medical situations
- Scary but rare medical scenarios
- Drug-drug interactions
- And, if time permits, we’ll touch on the controversial topic of "bad trips" and what that really means in the context of psilocybin safety.
