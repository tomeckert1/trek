### Scheduling and Reclassification

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
A paper by Johnson, Griffiths, et al. examined the criteria in the Controlled Substances Act — how drugs are categorized into Schedules I through V.

Their conclusion? Based on what we know, psilocybin *should not be in Schedule I*. It could be placed no more strictly than Schedule IV.

As you may know, Schedule IV drugs are not totally benign — but they are considered significantly safer and more therapeutic than Schedule I drugs.

So hopefully, in the scope of our careers, we’ll see this reclassification.
