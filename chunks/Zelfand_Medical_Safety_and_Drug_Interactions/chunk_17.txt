### Drug-Drug Interactions Overview

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
You’re not expected to be a *pharmacologist*, but you *will* see clients on psychiatric medications.

> “Whether or not you work with them, they’ll still knock on your door.”

### SSRI and Psilocybin: Serotonin Syndrome?

*Claimed risk:* SSRI + psilocybin = serotonin syndrome
*Reality:* Probably a **myth**, but we need more data.
- SSRIs increase serotonin in the synapse by *blocking reuptake*.
- Psilocybin binds to the *5-HT2A receptor*.
- Only one SSRI, *escitalopram*, has been formally studied in this context.
- No significant harm observed.
- *Possible blunting* of psychedelic effect due to *downregulated serotonin receptors*.

> “We can usually override blunting with a *booster dose*, not by starting higher.”

### Blunting: How to Manage It

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- Don’t increase dose preemptively.
- Instead, monitor and *add a booster* if needed.

> “You might blow them to the moon otherwise.”

Skipping a dose of SSRI does *not* resolve blunting—effects of SSRIs persist for *weeks to months*.

### Risk Factors for Serotonin Toxicity

*Dr. Erica Zelfand:*
*More likely with:*
- *Two or more* serotonin-affecting medications (e.g., SSRI + SNRI)
- *MAOIs* (rarely prescribed today)
- Some supplements (e.g., *5-HTP*)
- Recreational polypharmacy

*Recommendation:*
Avoid combining drugs that *increase serotonin levels* from multiple pathways.

### Stimulants and Psilocybin

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Examples:*
- Prescription: Adderall, Ritalin (for ADHD)
- Recreational: Methamphetamine, Cocaine
- Over-the-counter: Caffeine

*Guidance:*
- Avoid stimulant use *1 day before and after* a psilocybin session.
- Risk of increased *agitation*, *muscle spasms*, and unpleasant overstimulation.
- Especially relevant for people taking ADD/ADHD medications.

> “Most people can skip a day or two of their meds without any big deal. Just something to have on your radar.”

### Benzodiazepines (Benzos)

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Common Names:*
- Xanax (Alprazolam)  
- Valium (Diazepam)  
- Ativan (Lorazepam)

*Function:*
- Central nervous system depressants  
- Act on *GABA* receptors  
- Used for anxiety, sleep, social ease

*Key Risks:*
- Can *dampen or abort* a psilocybin trip
- *Not dangerous* in interaction per se, but:
  - May reduce therapeutic benefit
  - May result in *no launch or a muted trip*

> “Some people try to skip their dose the day of. That’s *dangerous*.”

*Critical Warning:*
- *DO NOT* encourage abrupt discontinuation.
- Can cause *seizures*, *life-threatening withdrawal*, and *long-term damage*.

> “The only time I’ve seen someone code in ibogaine work? They stopped their benzos without telling us.”

### Lithium and Psilocybin

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Absolute contraindication per OHA*

*Critical Warning:*
- Lowers the *seizure threshold*
- Combining with psilocybin increases seizure risk
- Must be *off lithium for 30 days* before proceeding

### Recreational Drug Use and Psilocybin

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- Most adverse events in the literature involve *poly-drug use* in recreational settings.

*Examples:*
- Alcohol + psilocybin
- Cannabis + psilocybin
- MDMA or cocaine + psilocybin

*Facilitator Screening Questions:*
- Does this person use other substances?
- Do they have a *substance use disorder*?
- Were they honest on their intake form?

> “You can’t just ask: ‘Were you honest on your intake form?’ You have to follow your *spidey sense*.”

### Cannabis + Psilocybin

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*OHA Regulations:*
- *Cannabis cannot be combined* with psilocybin in licensed service centers.

*Underground / Retreat Settings:*
- Cannabis is sometimes used to “launch” a psilocybin trip
- Can *shorten time to peak*, *reduce session length variability*
- However, it can also:
  - *Spin people out*
  - Cause *dry eyes*, *cotton mouth*, and *increase bad trips*

*Best Practice:*
- Stick with *booster doses* of psilocybin rather than cannabis augmentation.
