### Realities of the Healthcare System

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Don’t assume clients are actively involved in the healthcare system.
- Many people haven’t seen a *primary care doctor* in years
- Others rely on *Google* for their health info
- Just because someone is *on a medication* doesn’t mean they’re under *active care*

> “You might hear: ‘I’ve been on this med for ten years.’ And then you ask when they last saw a doctor: ‘Oh, urgent care... three years ago.’”

This is why *screening and confirmation* are so important—*don’t take client claims at face value.*

### Q: How is Active Suicidality Defined?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
There’s a *spectrum* of suicidal thoughts.
- *Passive thoughts*: “Sometimes I don’t want to be here.”
- *Active ideation*: “If this doesn’t work, I’m going to pull the trigger.”

Key signs of active suicidality:
- Has a *plan*
- Feels they are at *imminent risk*
- Speaks of this being their “*last hope*”

> “That person might be better served by emergency psychiatric care—not a psilocybin session.”

### Q: Can we have aspirin on hand in case of heart attack?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Technically, administering aspirin would be considered *administering a medication*, which is *outside the facilitator scope*.
- If 911 dispatch instructs you to give aspirin: *great that you have it*
- But do not *proactively* administer it

Also: *aspirin can worsen a hemorrhagic stroke*, so if you're wrong—it could make things worse.

### Q: Should 911 be called in front of the client?

Use *your judgment*:
- Never leave a client *unattended*
- If needed, have another facilitator *stay with the client* while you call
- Calling 911 can be *reassuring* to the client if done calmly

> “Say: ‘I’m going to get you help. You’re safe. Help is on the way.’”

### Q: Should facilitators accompany the client to the hospital?

**Tom Eckert:**

> “I don’t see a downside to that. I wouldn’t leave someone’s side.”

**Dr. Zelfand:**

And even if *EMTs don’t let you in the ambulance*, you can *follow and meet them at the hospital*.

> “You’re their psychic bodyguard.”

### Field Story: From Mario (Mexico)

**Mario:**

At Nido (a care center in Mexico), a guest had trouble breathing while on ketamine.
- Medical staff arrived and were *rushed and loud*
- This made the client panic more

One staff member sat with her, held her hand, spoke calmly—this *helped immensely*.

> “Being with them in a psychedelic-informed way really matters.”
