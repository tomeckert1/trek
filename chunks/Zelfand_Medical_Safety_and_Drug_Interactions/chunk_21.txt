### Q&A: Neurotoxicity, SSRIs, Pregnancy, Client Medications

**student***
What does neurotoxicity (serotonin toxicity) look like?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- Serotonin toxicity (aka serotonin syndrome) mimics infection:
  - High body temperature

*Oral Ingestion Pathway:*
  - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
  - Confusion, agitation
  - Sweating, shivering, muscle twitching
  - High blood pressure, high heart rate
- *Red flag signs*:
  - Fever > 104°F (40°C)
  - Muscle jerking/spasms
  - Seizure
  - Persistent confusion, unconsciousness
- *Key clue*: If symptoms *last longer than the trip*, suspect toxicity

*Common serotonin-affecting drugs:*
- SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs
- Tramadol, 5-HTP, MDMA

**student:**
Can psilocybin cause harm during pregnancy?*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- No clinical data available
- Anecdotal: some indigenous traditions use psilocybin in pregnancy
- For legal and liability reasons: *avoid psilocybin during pregnancy*
- If pregnancy discovered afterward, unknown risk to fetus

**student**
How do you know if an SSRI is blunting the effect of psilocybin?*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- You *don’t know in advance*
- Strategy:
  - Start with standard dose

*Common serotonin-affecting drugs:*
  - Assess after ~1 hour
  - If client reports minimal or no effect → consider *booster*
- Blunting is typically *consistent* across multiple sessions

**student:** 
Can clients bring Ativan or ibuprofen into a session?*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- Yes, with conditions:
  - Clients must bring their *own prescribed meds*
  - Both *client and facilitator must sign* an OHA form acknowledging this
  - Facilitators *cannot administer* medications
- OTC meds (like ibuprofen) are allowed if:
  - Pre-approved by facilitator
  - Self-administered by the client
