### Confusion vs Emergency: How to Tell the Difference

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
While we're waiting for Lisa to set up the breakout rooms, let me add a point:

Psychedelics *disorganize the brain*. That can be therapeutic, but it can also cause *confusing symptoms*.
- Clients might *speak in tongues*
- They may seem *disoriented* or say strange things
- That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re having a stroke or medical emergency
