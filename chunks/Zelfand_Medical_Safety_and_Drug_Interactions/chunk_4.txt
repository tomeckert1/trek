### Psilocybin Risk Overview

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
There is no known lethal dose of psilocybin. I mention this in every talk I give. The threshold for toxicity through oral consumption is essentially impossible to reach — you'd have to eat hundreds of grams of mushrooms. That estimate is theoretical, based on rat studies. We haven’t seen such toxicity occur in the literature.

Now, in Oregon service centers, this isn’t really a concern. The psilocybin products are licensed and standardized for psilocybin and psilocin content. But recreationally, we’ve seen people harmed because they foraged mushrooms incorrectly — picking toxic species thinking they were psilocybin. That can cause serious organ damage.

So: *know what you're taking*, even though foraging isn’t legal in this context.

### Harm Potential Compared to Other Substances

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s revisit a chart some of you have seen: a UK study analyzing drugs by their harm to self and others. Alcohol ranked as the most harmful, and it's the only drug where harm to others outweighed harm to self — think of drunk driving or violence.

On the opposite end of the spectrum: psilocybin mushrooms. There is some evidence of harm to self, but it's extremely low. Harm to others is almost negligible.

So yes, I’ll be covering some scary possibilities in this talk. But I want to be clear at the outset: *psilocybin is generally very safe*, especially when used with care and knowledge.
