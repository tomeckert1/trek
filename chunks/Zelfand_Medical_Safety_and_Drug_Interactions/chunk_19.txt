### Pill Shaming in Psychedelic Culture

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- There’s a growing culture of *pill shaming* (e.g., “My drugs are better than your drugs”)
- This alienates clients and reinforces stigma
- Clients with people-pleasing tendencies may *inappropriately taper or stop meds* to gain facilitator approval

*Facilitator Practice Tip:*
- Be mindful of how you talk about medications
- Don’t assume psilocybin can or should “cure everything”
