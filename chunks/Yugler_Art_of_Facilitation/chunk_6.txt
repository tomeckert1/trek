### Intangible Skills of Facilitation

**Simon Yugler:**
Now we’re going to get more concrete—but paradoxically, we’re going to talk about things that are incredibly hard to define or teach. These are the *intangible skills* of psychedelic facilitation.

*Experiential vs. Theoretical Knowledge*

I’ll say it again:  
> *The map is not the territory.*

I can give you tools and ideas, but experience is your best teacher.

These skills live in the body, in presence, in *being*, not just in concepts.

*Interoception: The Inner Compass*

*Interoception* is your ability to perceive what’s happening internally—emotionally, somatically, intuitively.

Jason reminded me: trauma can *block interoception*, because the nervous system may be dysregulated. That’s why *personal work* is essential for facilitators.

**Simon Yugler:**
*Four Vectors of Interoception*

1. *Gut*  
   - “Something feels off.”  
   - You might feel nausea or unease during intake. Sometimes the gut says “no.”

2. *Heart*  
   - Unexpected emotions.  
   - You might tear up, feel grief, or warmth—for no clear reason.

3. *Body*  
   - Muscle tension, breath holding, need to move.  
   - Where are you holding stress?

4. *Mind*  
   - Thoughts or intuitive insights, but not analysis.  
   - Remember: the mind is a great servant, a terrible master.
