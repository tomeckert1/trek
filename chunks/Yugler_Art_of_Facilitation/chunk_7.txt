### Intangible Skills: A Breakdown

**Simon Yugler:**
Each of these deserves its own deep dive. But here’s a brief overview.

*Attention*
> “Alertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity.” — David Whyte

The quality of your attention matters.  
Are you scanning? Are you with them?  
Are you listening to the room, the client, the silence?

**Simon Yugler:**
*Intention*
Client intention gets a lot of attention—but what about yours?

Micro-intentions matter:
- Why am I talking?  
- Why am I moving?  
- Why am I touching?

*A good check-in:*
> “W.A.I.T.” = Why Am I Talking?

I offer a rough formula:  
> *Intention = Presence + Attunement + Action*

Like an eagle striking water: minimal, precise, clean.

**Simon Yugler:**

*Voice*
Tone, volume, speed, energy—these matter *as much as words*.

Don’t act calm—*be* calm.  
Let your voice carry *what’s true*. Psychedelic states are highly suggestible.

*Attunement*
> “If you're guessing what to do, you're not attuned.” — Russell Muñoz

Attunement means you’re not in your head. You’re not performing.  

**Simon Yugler:**
You’re *feeling* what’s happening and matching it.

Tal will talk about this much more in her section.

*Breath*
The most useful tool of all.

- Grounds you in intensity  
- Regulates your nervous system  
- Anchors you when you don’t know what to do

*Listening*
The root of it all.

Are you really listening—not just to words, but to body, tone, silence?

**Simon Yugler:**
Let's take a moment. Close your eyes. Breathe.

Reconnect with your *interoception*:

**A good check-in:**
- Gut  
- Heart  
- Body  
- Mind

Listen again to the *still small voice*.
