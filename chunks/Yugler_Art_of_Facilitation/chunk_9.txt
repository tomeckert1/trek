### Right Speech: The Power of Language

**Simon Yugler:**
Words carry energy. Use them wisely.

From Buddhism:  
> *Right Speech* = The right words at the right time

*Three Levels of Speech*

1. *Speak to the Heart*  
   From empathy, connection, and presence

2. *Speak to the Moment*  
   Reflect what’s true *right now*

3. *Speak to the Spirit*  
   Touch the deeper truths—whatever that means to you

**Simon Yugler:**
*Tips for Skillful Language*
- Avoid centering yourself  
  (e.g., “I think you’re experiencing…” — no. Stay with *them*)
- Don’t go to the mind  
  (e.g., “What do you think about…” pulls people out of experience)
- Speak from joined presence  
  (e.g., “You’re doing it. I’m here.”)
