### The Map Is Not the Territory

**Simon Yugler:**
I’ve said this a number of times, but I’ll say it again: *the map is not the territory*—and never will be. Especially when it comes to psychedelics.

I’m about to present a bunch of words and ideas to you. But there is no substitute for the lived experience of doing this work—or for receiving the medicine yourself.

I could give you an elaborate conceptual map, framework, or blueprint, and it still wouldn’t fully articulate the complexities of what happens in facilitation, or how to respond. So I’ll say this from the outset:

> *Experience is your best teacher.*

The territory changes. Like a river that carves a new path each season, or a forest that burns and regrows, the terrain is living and dynamic. The map is static. It’s helpful, but it isn’t the thing itself.
