### Q&A Highlights (Lightning Round)

**student:** 
Is a deep breath ever disruptive to a client?*  

**Simon Yugler:** 
It depends. If it’s for the facilitator’s own regulation and is subtle, it’s usually fine. If it’s dramatic or audible, check the context.

**student:** 
What about movement as a way to move energy?*  

**Simon Yugler:** 
Yes—with care and consent. It may help some clients when they’re stuck. Offer it as an invitation, not a directive.

**student:**  
Is it okay to spray yourself with rosewater during session?*  

**Simon Yugler:** 
Yes, especially if it's to tend to your own energetic field.

**student:**  
How many personal journeys should a facilitator have?*  

**Simon Yugler:** 
There’s no fixed number. It’s about depth, not quantity. You can't take someone somewhere you haven’t been.

**student:** 
Where can I find internships or shadowing opportunities?*  

**Simon Yugler:** 
Currently limited, but InnerTrek is exploring this. Stay connected. Peer support and apprenticeship are essential, especially post-graduation.
