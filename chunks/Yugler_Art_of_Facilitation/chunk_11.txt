### Energetic Tools: Moving Stuck Energy

**Tal Sharabi:**
Sometimes clients get stuck or overwhelmed. These are three tools to consider—used *with consent*, care, and subtlety.

1. *Scent*
Scent can awaken or shift internal states.

- *Examples*: Sage, palo santo, rose water, lavender, agua florida
- Used sparingly near the face or in the room
- Breaks trance states gently
- Useful if someone is looping, overwhelmed, or energetically heavy

*Note:* Always ask permission beforehand. Some clients may be sensitive.

2. *Sound*
Sound is ancient medicine.
- *Examples*: Drum, rattle, chime, voice, recorded music
- Vibrations can anchor, shift, or focus attention
- Rattles (especially in peyote or ayahuasca traditions) = rhythm, structure, protection
- Drums = grounding, deep body resonance

Again: get consent. Use intentionally. Avoid overuse.

**Tal Sharabi:**
3. *Touch*
Profound, powerful, and deeply regulated by consent and context.
- *Examples*:
  - Hand holding
  - Hand on shoulder
  - Gentle touch on chest or feet (if invited)
- Touch can:
  - Ground
  - Offer containment
  - Support the body’s natural movements

**Tal Sharabi:**
*Important:*
- Never initiate touch without prior consent.
- Always consider trauma history and cultural background.
- Be clear, slow, and attuned.

> Touch, scent, and sound all carry magnitude. Use them wisely.  
> Every action alters the flow. Stay with the pattern before shifting it.

Let’s pause.  
Breathe.  
Notice what’s arising now in your own field—your somatic signals, your subtle sense, your breath.
