### Keeping a Foot in Both Worlds

**Simon Yugler:**
I talk about this in my book, and I really love this metaphor.

Imagine an Irish druid fishing in a sacred pool—the Salmon of Knowledge.  
He’s standing with *one foot on land* and *one foot in the water*.

This is us, as facilitators.  
One foot in *ordinary reality*, and one in the *other world*, where our client is journeying.

Ways to Keep a Foot in Both Worlds

*Somatic Recollection*
Feel into your body—what is *your* felt sense of where your client is?
- They’re an hour into 35mg of psilocybin.  
- You hear deep breathing, spontaneous vocalizations.  
- Tune into your own nervous system: where are they?

**Simon Yugler:**
Use your *past journey experiences* to remember the terrain.  
What did it feel like to be where they are?

You don’t get lost in it—but *you bring your knowledge of it* into the room.

*Interoceptive Scanning*
Ground yourself through continuous self-awareness.

Check:
- Breath
- Tension
- Presence
- Emotional resonance

This is your anchor—the “foot on the land.”

**Simon Yugler:**
*Energetic Hygiene*

Sometimes *you* need clearing—rose water, sage, movement.

You might not know what’s clinging to you, but trust the sense:  
> “I need to clear something off.”

Tend to your energy so you can return fully.
