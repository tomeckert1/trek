### Entering the Space: Poetry and Philosophy

**Simon Yugler:**
As Nate accurately pointed out, this lecture is called *The Art of Facilitation*, which—honestly—is a tall order. I don't remember signing up for this lecture, but here we are. I'm showing up to the invitation to talk about something that’s actually quite hard to talk about. So, here we go.

I'm going to start us off with a poem, like I usually do with my home groups. This is from David Whyte, who I’ve been steeping in lately. The poem is called *Tobar Patrick*, which means “Patrick’s Well.” It’s about a place in Ireland, and I heard it when I was thinking about this lecture. It really spoke to me about some of the intangible, hard-to-speak-of elements in facilitation. That’s my goal tonight—to talk about the things that are really hard to talk about in this work.

I invite you to listen with your third ear, see with your third eye, and receive it through the lens of facilitation and altered states of consciousness.

> Be impatient with easy explanations

> Walk the green road above the bay

> Let that Atlantic gleam be ahead of you  
> and the gray light of the bay below you  

**Simon Yugler:**
> until you catch down on your left  
> the break in the wall.  
>   
> For just above in the shadows, you'll find it hidden,  
> a curved arm of rock holding the water close to the mountain.  
> A just-lit surface,  
> smoothing a scattering of coins.  
>   
> And in the niche above,  
> notes to the dead and supplications for those who still live.  
>   
> But for now, you are alone with the transfiguration  

**Simon Yugler:**
> and ask no healing for your own,  
> but look down as if looking through time,  
> as if through a rent veil  
> from the other side of the question you've refused to ask.  
>   
> And you remember now  
> that clear stream of generosity from which you drank,  
> how as a child, your arms could rise  
> and your palms turn out  
> to take the blessing of the world.

I love this poem. That first line—“turn sideways into the light”—is a reference to Irish mythology. It refers to a group of people in Irish myth called the *Tuatha Dé Danann*, a semi-divine race that lived on the land before humans.

When the Celts arrived to invade, swords drawn, the *Tuatha Dé Danann* lined up for battle—but instead of fighting, they turned sideways into the light and disappeared. They refused to engage in that kind of interaction.

**Simon Yugler:**
I love that as a metaphor for what we’re doing in facilitation. We turn sideways into the light. We don’t block it or try to eclipse it—we take ourselves out of the center so that we can help steward the questions that emerge. Like Whyte says, “Teach that part of the mind that wants to know everything not to begin questions it cannot answer.”

This poem, and this class, and that opening witnessing exercise—it’s all an invitation. As of this moment, I want you to step into the role of facilitator.

It starts now.

Inhabit this space in yourself. Practice this way of being in our classes, in home groups, in intensives, in all your interactions. You are now stepping sideways into the role of facilitator.

So, let’s look at what we’re going to explore tonight:
- Nuanced elements of psychedelic facilitation  

**Simon Yugler:**
- Philosophy and core concepts  
- Intangible skills (more on that soon)  
- Case studies from my own experiences—what I call my “altar of failure”

My hope is that you walk away with a deeper map. One that goes beyond the “101” level. We’ll start conceptual, move into the intangible, and then end with concrete examples.
Let me know when you're ready for the next chunk: “The Map Is Not the Territory” through the introduction of Wu Wei.
