### Reconnecting with the Still Small Voice

**Simon Yugler:**
> “Let’s just take one minute… notice where you are right now.”
- Tune into interoception: gut, heart, body, and mind
- Use the breath to return to presence
- Notice where attention is placed
- Track intuitive or energetic messages, somatic or mental

### Poetic Closure: *Tobar Patrick* by David Whyte (Second Reading)

**Simon Yugler:**
> Now, after the teachings, the poem may land differently—more deeply.

Key themes:
- Turning sideways into the light: a metaphor for stepping out of ego and into the mystery  
- Refusing easy explanations  
- Standing alone with the transfiguration  
- Remembering the “clear stream of generosity”  
- Returning to the childlike openness that receives the blessing of the world

**Tal Sharabi:**
- Simon has captured “the essence” behind attunement, integrity, and presence
- These are the intangible dimensions of *being*, not just doing or knowing
- This talk invites repeated listening—as with poetry, meaning deepens with time
