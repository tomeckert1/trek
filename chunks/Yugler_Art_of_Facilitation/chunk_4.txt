### The Still Small Voice

**Simon Yugler:**
Who’s familiar with the idea of the “still small voice”?

This is a concept that shows up in many traditions. Poet *Mary Oliver* refers to it. Some might call it *intuition*, a *guardian angel*, or even a *demon on the shoulder*. Whatever form it takes, it’s an *inner knowing*—a voice we can hear if we get quiet enough.

As facilitators, one of our greatest tools is our capacity to *listen to that still small voice*—especially when we don’t know what to do. And so much of psychedelic facilitation is being able to sense what is needed in a moment of unknowing.

How Do We Hear It?

I reflected on this and came up with *three key conditions* that allow us to hear the still small voice:

**Simon Yugler:**
*1. Presence*
> “We must be present to hear.”  
It’s what we were practicing at the beginning of class—simply witnessing.  
If we’re not present, if our mind is racing or we’re distracted, there’s no room for this voice to speak.

*2. Feeling Our Feelings*
*Carl Jung* said the “feeling function” is highly underdeveloped in the modern world.  

**Simon Yugler:**
To hear the still small voice, we must have access to our own emotional life.

That doesn’t mean making it about us during facilitation—but we need to know how to feel our own grief, our own joy, our own rage, our own awe. Because that is how the still small voice often speaks: *through feeling*.

*3. Intuition*
When we are present and in touch with our feelings, *intuition* begins to emerge.

You can’t explain intuition. You just *know*.

> “You can’t say why you know. You just do.”

**Simon Yugler:**
*Journal Prompt: Tuning In*

We paused here for a reflective writing exercise. The invitation was:

1. *How can you hear your still small voice?*  
   (What’s the method or state that makes it available?)

2. *What does it sound like?*  
   (Is it a voice, a color, a bodily feeling?)

3. *What is it saying to you right now?*

4. *How do you know it’s not just your monkey mind?*  
   (How do you know it’s *that* voice?)

[*10 minutes of journaling. Then return to group.*]

**Simon Yugler:**
The goal of this entire class is to begin *living in that state* of tuning in.  
To *practice listening* to the still small voice *every day*.  

To use it as a *guide* when the maps fail.  
To *practice being a facilitator*, not just learn about it.

> *It starts now.*
