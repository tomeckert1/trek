### From Woo-Woo to Wu Wei

**Simon Yugler:**
So early in the program, I asked about everyone’s “woo level.” Some of you may remember that. Let’s do it again.

Put into the chat your current woo level.  
- 10/10 = Sign me up for the tarot/astrology/microdosing/skydiving workshop  
- 1/10 = I only believe in concrete physical reality

[*Participants reply with scores ranging from 4 to 1000, some joking, others sincere.*]

Alright, solidly woo. Good to know.

**Simon Yugler:**
But I want to make a point:  
> Woo-Woo is out. Wu Wei is in.

Let me explain.

*Wu Wei: The Art of Effortless Action*

*Wu Wei (無為)* is a foundational concept in *Taoism*, which translates loosely as:
- Non-action  
- Effortless action  
- Non-striving  

It’s the idea that the Tao—the Way—is always flowing. Always in a state of natural, harmonious, effortless unfolding.

**Simon Yugler:**
Think of Bruce Lee’s “Be like water.” That’s *Wu Wei*. Water:
- Stays low  
- Finds the path of least resistance  
- Is humble and patient  
- Always flows where it’s needed, not where it’s forced  

As facilitators, *Wu Wei* is a beautiful aspiration. We aim to be like water—attuned, flowing, responsive, relaxed.

Not pushing. Not striving. But deeply *present* and *effective*.

So:  
> *Woo-Woo is out. Wu Wei is in.*
