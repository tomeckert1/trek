### Why Consent Matters in Psilocybin Work

**Emma Knighton:**
What you just heard in these stories is why we center consent in psychedelic services. People need to feel *safe enough* to enter vulnerable, transformative states. Without a strong consensual container, that safety isn’t possible.

We live in a *compliance culture*, not a consent culture. People are socialized to go along with authority—facilitators included. This means clients are often primed to say yes, even when they mean no.

As facilitators, it's our job to be *safe enough to say no to.* That starts with *your own relationship* to yes and no. If you don’t have access to your own no, you can’t create a strong consent container.

### Trauma-Attuned Consent: A Protocol

**Emma Knighton:**
All of this is about *preparation*. Consent is not a one-time checklist. It’s *alive*, cocreated, and embodied. Here’s a protocol I teach, adapted from kink and BDSM education.

*1. Assess the Client’s Relationship to Yes and No*

Clients must be able to give a felt, embodied yes or no. If not, more prep is needed.

*Tools:*
- Playful practice: “Will you give me all your money?” or “Do you like strawberries?”
- Embodied practice: Say “no” three times. Reflect on what they felt. Repeat with “yes.”

Use these practices to develop a map of the client's authentic responses. Then make agreements: e.g., “If you say yes too quickly, I’ll check in again.”

*2. Discuss Power Dynamics and Risk*

There is inherent *risk* in psychedelic work. This doesn’t make it wrong—it just means we must *consent to risk*.

Power is not inherently bad. But power dynamics (facilitator–client, social location, privilege/oppression) must be named.

For example, I’m white, queer, non-monogamous, and able-bodied. I’ve had sessions where a facilitator’s assumptions around non-monogamy caused me harm. That’s a rupture.

Facilitators must do their own work around *white supremacy, gender norms, heteronormativity*, and other systemic forces—and talk to clients about how their identities and lived experience intersect with the work.

**Emma Knighton:**
*3. Trauma Assessment and Triggers*

You don’t need to be a clinician to ask basic trauma-informed questions:
- What do you want to work on?
- What does this remind you of in your life?
- How might that show up between us?

You can also ask:
- “Can you show me with your body what it looks like when you go into shame?”
- “How will I know if this is showing up?”

The goal is to *map patterns* that might emerge in the session so you can hold them skillfully.

*4. Identify Hard and Soft Boundaries*

*Hard boundaries* are non-negotiable. For me, these include:
- No sexual or romantic engagement—ever.
- No physical aggression toward myself, the client, or the space.
- Clients may not leave the space unless we mutually agree it’s safe.

*Soft boundaries* allow for negotiation. Example: self-disclosure. I generally redirect personal questions unless I sense that disclosure would benefit the client’s process.

Clients also get to define their *hard and soft boundaries*. Touch is a big one:
- The OHA allows touch on feet, hands, shoulders, back of the head, or a hug.
- Clients must decide which of these, if any, are okay.
- If touch is a soft boundary, we *practice* ahead of time.

**Emma Knighton:**
*5. What If a Client Changes Their Mind?*

If a client *initially declined touch* and then asks for it during a session, I *do not change the agreement*.

Why? Because the part of them that said “no” may be offline due to the medicine. That part will come back—and if I broke the agreement, it’s a *rupture*.

Instead:
- I acknowledge their desire.
- Offer alternative options: self-touch, a pillow with pressure, a weighted blanket.
- Reaffirm: “We’ll talk about this in integration.”

The integrity of our *prior agreements* matters more than gratifying an in-the-moment request.

*6. Safe Words and Nonverbal Signals*

From BDSM practice, we use *safe words* to stop all activity immediately.
- Have a *verbal* and *nonverbal* safe word.
- My verbal safe word is *pineapple*.
- Nonverbal signals should be clear (e.g., hand signal) and rehearsed.

Review safe words with the client the day of the session. Make sure they remember both.

**Emma Knighton:**
*7. Practicing Touch Beforehand*

If touch is on the table, *rehearse* it during prep:
- *Accepting*: You offer touch, client says “yes.”
- *Declining*: Client says “no,” you respect it.
- *Changing Mind*: Client accepts then says “stop”—you immediately respond.
- *Requesting*: Client asks for touch, you say yes or no.
- *Negotiating*: Client asks for something outside the agreement (e.g., “lay your body on top of me”). You say no, and *offer alternatives*.

These rehearsals teach clients what a respectful no feels like. They help prevent going into the *shadow of allow* (enduring something they don’t want).

*8. Revoking Consent Mid-Session*

What if a client wants to *completely revoke consent* during the session?

This is rare, but serious. It may be because they feel unsafe—especially due to something the facilitator did.

Plan ahead:
- Identify a *support person* who can arrive within 20–30 minutes.
- If the client insists on not being in the room with you, and they’ve already ingested the medicine:
  - Keep the door open (to stay legally present).
  - Physically distance yourself as much as possible.
  - Call the designated support person.

This protocol must be documented in the OHA intake paperwork, especially for licensed service centers.

**Emma Knighton:**
*9. Space Setup and Ritual Objects*

Clients should *co-create the space*:
- Show them the setup.
- Ask: “Are you comfortable with everything here? Would you like to move anything?”

*Rituals or objects* (e.g., spiritual icons, smudging, music):
- Who are they for—you or the client?
- If a client isn’t comfortable, don’t use it.
- Always *get consent* for rituals, and explain the meaning and purpose.

Example: A gay client with a history of *conversion therapy* may be triggered by spiritual language or ritual settings. Don’t assume what’s healing for you will be neutral or safe for them.

*10. Aftercare Plans*

*Aftercare* refers to how we tend to ourselves and our clients post-session.

*For the client:*
- What kind of food, space, or company will support them afterward?
- Any allergies or restrictions?
- Will someone be there to meet them or take them home?
- Encourage time in nature, rest, or gentle self-connection.

*For the facilitator:*
- You need an aftercare plan too.
- Sessions are long and intense—prioritize your own regulation, nourishment, and decompression.
- This is part of being an *ethical practitioner*.
