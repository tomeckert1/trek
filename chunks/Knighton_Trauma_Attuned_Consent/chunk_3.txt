### Journaling Exercise

**Emma Knighton:**
Let’s begin with a journaling prompt. You’ll have 5 minutes to reflect on the question:

> *What is your personal relationship with consent?*

If you want more structure, consider:
- How easy or difficult is it to connect to your own yes or no?
- How easy is it to express that yes or no?
- What gets in the way?
- How easy is it to respect others' yeses and nos?
- What family, cultural, or ancestral stories arise?

_(Five-minute journaling period.)_

### Group Sharing

**Emma Knighton:**
Let’s hear from a few of you. One to three people. Raise your hand to share.

**Maya:**
Consent has always been difficult for me. My first sexual experience was rape, and I had an abusive, domineering father. I was responsible for his feelings. I’ve worked hard to hold boundaries for myself, but I never want anyone else to feel the way I’ve felt. So I respect other people’s boundaries deeply.

**Emma Knighton:**
Thank you, Maya. Let’s all take a breath together. Thank you for that vulnerability.

**Nina:**
Similar story for me. My mom wasn’t domineering, but I was often responsible for her feelings. That carried into adulthood. For me, saying no is hard when I don’t feel emotionally safe. I’ve done a lot of work to create inner safety and be consistent with boundaries.

**Emma Knighton:**
Thank you. You’re speaking to the heart of today’s topic—emotional safety is essential for authentic consent.

**Lara Lee:**
I was raised in an enmeshed, codependent family. Saying no meant punishment. I learned to people please, suppress my emotions, and silence myself. I’ve done a lot of work learning to honor myself.

**Emma Knighton:**
Thank you for that. Again, this is why we need this work.
