### Introduction

**Gina Gratza:**
Tonight, we are inviting Emma Knighton. She holds an MA and LMHC and is a somatic trauma therapist, psychedelic integration therapist, educator, and conscious organizer. Emma’s clinical and leadership work is grounded in queer, consent-based, feminist, anti-oppression, and pro-liberation frameworks.  

Emma is in sacred relationship with her ancestors, tree elders, plant teachers, and the collective consciousness. She also does equity organizing in the psychedelic ecosystem. We're so excited to have you with us tonight, Emma. Welcome.

**Emma Knighton:**
Thanks, Gina. Appreciate that.  
Hello, everyone. It's good to see your faces.

### Framing the Topic: Trauma-Attuned Consent

**Emma Knighton:**
Today, our class is called *Trauma-Attuned Consent*, and we'll be talking about consent practices in psilocybin facilitation. Before jumping into slides, I want to honor the lineages from which these practices originate—especially the *kink* and *sex work* communities.

These are communities with long histories of criminalization, marginalization, and violence—and also wisdom, love, play, pleasure, and community education. Much of what I teach today comes from these communities. Some I belong to; some I don't. Either way, I carry these teachings with honor and pride.
