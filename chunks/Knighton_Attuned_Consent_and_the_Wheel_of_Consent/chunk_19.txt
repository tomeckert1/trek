### Looking Ahead: Group Facilitation & Field Theory

**Emma Knighton:**
This work continues.

When we talk about *group facilitation*, I’ll introduce you to *field theory*—how the relational field operates in a collective.

We’ll expand these same skills—attunement, dual awareness, consent, presence—into *the many*.

### Closing Quote

Let me leave you with this from *Deb Dana*:

> *“It is in this experience of finding our way of being anchored in ventral safety, and offering that welcome to others, that we begin to change the world—one nervous system at a time.”*

Thank you, everyone.
