### Opening Reflection: Your Relationship with Consent

**Emma Knighton:**
Please pull out something to write with—paper, phone, computer—and take a few minutes to reflect on this prompt:

> *What is your personal relationship with consent?*

If you need more direction, consider these:
- How easy or difficult is it for you to connect to your own yes or no?
- How easy or difficult is it to express that—verbally or nonverbally?
- How easy or difficult is it for you to respect others' yeses and noes?
- What gets in the way of all this?
- Are there stories that come up?

About 30 more seconds. You can come back to this later if needed.  
Okay, wrap up your thought.  
Put down your writing pencils.

I’m curious if anyone is willing to share what came up for them.

### Reflections on Consent: Student Voices

**Student 1 (Tasha):**
I love consent. I love the topic of consent.  
It’s really easy for my yeses and noes to come up and be vocalized—to the point that I’m regularly called a bitch because I’m so secure in them.  
I figured out a long time ago that saying yes to things I don’t want to do leads to doing things I don’t want to do.  
And I never want anyone else to do anything for me that they don’t actually want to do.  
So I’m an *over-consenter*—I regularly check in with people to make sure they’re doing what they want to do.

**Emma Knighton:**
Were you always like that, or did you have to work to get there?

**Tasha:**
I definitely had to work on it.  
Growing up, I got a lot by manipulating. People would do things for me that they didn’t want to do, and then they’d be upset about it.  
So I learned that the easiest way to avoid blame was to make sure everyone’s really choosing what they want to do.

**Emma Knighton:**
Yeah, beautiful. Thank you.

**Participant:**
For me, it was kind of the opposite.  
I always struggled with saying no and meaning it when I was younger.  
It wasn’t until I invested in my own self-love and self-respect that saying no became easier.  
It’s been a lifelong, nonlinear path.  
Respecting other people’s noes was always easy—respecting my own, not so much.

**Emma Knighton:**
Thank you.

**Participant:**
There’s a tension between being rigid and allowing for adaptability.  
I wrote about the struggle of fighting when you don’t want to disagree.  
Sometimes, out of courtesy or fear of triggering someone else, it’s hard to push boundaries around consent—even though it needs to be done.

As someone who doesn’t follow rules easily, it can feel hypocritical when I see someone else breaking a rule I’ve broken before.  
It’s a balance: watching closely, especially when safety isn’t clearly at risk.

**Participant:**
I’ve learned to make space to hear someone else’s yes or no *without preparing a rebuttal* while they speak.  
So in the end, I do okay—walking the line between not overthinking and not reacting too fast.

**Emma Knighton:**
Yeah. Thank you. You brought up something really important we’ll return to.

**Participant:**
I love “no.” It’s my favorite word—very easy for me to say.  
I’m working on saying yes more.  
But I’ve gotten feedback from friends that I’m not always good at listening for other people’s noes—especially when they don’t say it clearly.

Like if I ask to stay the night at a friend’s place and they say “yes” but with a sigh...  
Their words say yes, but the sigh means something else.  

**Participant:**
I’m learning to clock that.

**Emma Knighton:**
That’s a really important example, and we’re going to go deeper into that.  
Many of our clients will do exactly that—say “yes” when their body says “no.”

So most of this class is about how we make space for that.  
How do we attune and create conditions so we can trust what a client says?
