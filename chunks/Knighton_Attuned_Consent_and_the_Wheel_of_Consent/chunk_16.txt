### Coming Up: Attunement and Relational Presence

**Emma Knighton:**
We’re going to talk about *attunement* next:

- What does it mean to bring your full Self to meet someone else’s Self?
- How do we allow ourselves to be changed by the other person—without losing ourselves?
- How do we stay in connection, in the moment, while holding boundaries?

This is the *heart* of trauma-attuned consent.  
And it's the art of holding psychedelic space.

We’re going to explore:

- *Limbic resonance*  
- *Mirror neurons*  
- *Breath synchronization*  
- *Dual awareness*: tracking both yourself and your client

Let’s take a breath.

Let me know when you're ready to go deeper into *attunement and presence*.

### Attunement and Relational Presence
  
**Emma Knighton:**
Let’s talk about *attunement*.

Attunement is not just paying attention. It’s:

> *Bringing our full presence to meet another person—while allowing ourselves to be changed by the connection.*

It’s about *not merging*, but also not walling off.  
It’s allowing the interaction to shape us, while remaining in our center.

### The Alchemy of Attunement

**Emma Knighton:**
There’s an *alchemical process* to true attunement.

When we tune into someone with our whole being—nervous system, breath, intention—we create a relational field where transformation can happen.

This is *not just psychological*. It’s physiological.

### What Makes Attunement Possible?

**Emma Knighton:**
Attunement requires:

- *Presence* – the openness to unfolding possibilities
- *Mindfulness* – the commitment to stay connected to the present moment
- *Openness* – we don’t know what’s going to happen; we’re not trying to control it
- *Dual awareness* – tracking ourselves *and* the other person

Presence allows us to *meet* someone, instead of managing or fixing them.
