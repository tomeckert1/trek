### Closing Reflections

**Emma Knighton:**
After practicing, come back to your seat.  
Take a moment to pause. Breathe.

Let’s reflect together:

What did you notice?  
What did you learn about yourself in this practice?

**Student (Robin):**
I guess my natural self wants to do something silly.  
I really wanted to just walk in front of the camera and goof off—but I didn’t.  
That just came up for me. I wanted to be silly.

**Emma Knighton:**
You wanted to engage with people and bring humor. You wanted to connect through play.

**Student (Tessa):**
I remembered that my most authentic self is very childlike and curious.  
I wanted to wander around and touch things I hadn’t touched before.  
Sit in places I hadn’t sat. That’s what came up.

**Emma Knighton:**
Curious. Experiential. Yeah.

**Student:**
I was feeling like, “I’m too big to be playful like that.”  
It was interesting to hear people say “childlike” and “play” because… yeah, me too.  
Play is a big word for me.

**Student:**
Something came up around watching Tessa move—how big she was being.  
And it made me ask myself, “Do I want to be big too?”  
And I checked in and said, “No, I don’t. I want to be small.”  
I wanted to move slowly and intentionally and feel the ground beneath me.  
It felt really good to be mindful of my space and track my own rhythm.

**Emma Knighton:**
You were aware. You were checking in, tracking yourself moment to moment—  
Noticing what you wanted and honoring that.

**Student:**
The sense of “home” for me is definitely water.  
I was thinking about when I was in Croatia, sailing, surrounded by sunlight and movement.  
It’s really nourishing.

**Emma Knighton:**
I love how you named a *place*, but also a *state of being*.  
And that state—it’s always available to you.
