| Take     | *Violation, abuse, assault* (non-consensual taking) |
| Allow    | *Enduring* – tolerating something instead of choosing it |
| Serve    | *Martyrdom* – giving in a way that’s self-sacrificing or manipulative |
| Accept   | *Entitlement* – expecting to be served without awareness or gratitude |

*Allow → Endure*

If a client slips into *Endure*, they may think:
- “I don’t want to make this awkward.”
- “It’ll be over soon.”
- “I’ll just let them finish.”

They don’t feel like they can say no.  
They’re staying quiet to keep things smooth.

*Endure → Perceive Violation*

When someone is in Endure, they often *project* the facilitator into the *shadow of Take*—even if no actual violation occurred.

This is where *ethical complaints* can arise:
- The facilitator thinks they’re in Serve
- The client experiences it as Take

And of course, actual violations do happen.  
But often, this slippery, unconscious movement into Take is the danger zone.
