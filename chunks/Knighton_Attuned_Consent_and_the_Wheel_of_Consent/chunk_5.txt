### Lineages of Trauma-Attuned Consent

**Emma Knighton:**
This body of work I’m sharing—what I call *trauma-attuned consent*—comes from two main lineages:
1. *Kink and BDSM communities*  
2. *Sex work communities*

These are communities that have grappled deeply with consent, particularly in contexts that involve:
- *Touch*
- *Power dynamics*
- *Altered states of consciousness*

These communities have developed incredibly robust frameworks. They’ve figured out a lot—and we don’t need to reinvent the wheel. While not perfect, there is profound wisdom here.

I want to *honor and uplift* these communities.  
They’ve been:
- *Criminalized*
- *Stigmatized*
- And yet—immensely wise

I’m deeply grateful to the people who’ve taught me and allowed me to present this work in spaces like this.
