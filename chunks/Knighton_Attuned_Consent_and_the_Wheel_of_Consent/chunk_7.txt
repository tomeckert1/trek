### The Wheel of Consent

**Emma Knighton:**
Has anyone seen this before?

**Students:**
No.

**Emma Knighton:**
Amazing! First time for all of you. That’s great.

The *Wheel of Consent* was developed by Dr. Betty Martin, a sexological bodyworker.  
It originates in the lineage of sex work and somatic practice.

This framework emerged from her noticing something important:

> People often confuse *giving* with *doing*  
> and *receiving* with *being passive*

She realized that wasn’t accurate. So she created this tool to help people:
- Differentiate between roles  
- Clarify agreements  
- Deepen understanding of consent in *touch-based dynamics*

We’ll use this model to explore physical contact in psychedelic sessions.  

It’s a powerful lens for understanding *clear consent*.

You’ll also have a chance to *practice* with this model shortly.

### The Four Quadrants

**Emma Knighton:**
Let’s break it down.

There are four quadrants, created by asking two key questions:
1. *Who is this for?*  
2. *Who is doing the action?*

From those two questions, we get two sets of dynamics:
- *Serve / Accept*  
- *Take / Allow*

And a dividing line:
- Inside the black circle: *within consent*
- Outside the line: *outside consent*

Let’s look at the quadrants:
1. *Serve* – You do something *for someone else*.  
2. *Accept* – You receive something being done *for you*.  
3. *Take* – You do something *for yourself*, using another’s body or presence.  
4. *Allow* – You permit something to be done *to you*, for someone else’s benefit.

*Serve/Accept – The Facilitator-Client Baseline*

This is where you should be with your clients *all the time*.
- You (the facilitator) are in *Serve*: doing something *for* the client.  
- The client is in *Accept*: receiving the care or support you are offering.

It’s a *gift*—of your presence, attention, and service.

You’ve probably felt this dynamic in your own life.  

It’s clean, it’s grounded, and it’s centered in care.

### The Take / Allow Dynamic

**Emma Knighton:**
Now let’s talk about the *Take / Allow* dynamic.  
This one is more complex—especially in our culture.

If I’m in *Take*, I am doing something *for me*, using someone else’s body, time, or presence.

This is *not inherently bad*. It can be *consensual*.  
But because of how much harm has occurred in our society under the guise of taking, this quadrant brings up sensitivity.

*Why Practicing "Take" Matters*

Here’s why I teach this:

If you *don’t know what consensual Take feels like* in your body, your Serve won’t be clean.

Meaning:
- You may think you’re in Serve
- But you're unconsciously doing something for *yourself*
- That makes it *Take*, even if you're not aware of it

And that’s where things get sticky.

**Emma Knighton:**
*Slipping from Serve into Take*

Let me give you some examples of unconscious Take:

- You're sitting with a client in hour 3 or 4 of a session. You're getting bored.
- You say, “Maybe I’ll offer them a guided meditation.”

Who's that for?  
*You.* That’s *Take*—because you want stimulation or control.

Another example:
- A client is dysregulated.
- You offer to hold their hand—without them asking.
- You want to calm them down because *you’re* feeling anxious.

Again, who's that for?  
*You.* That’s Take.

Unless the client has clearly asked for that touch, or you’ve negotiated that kind of support in advance, you are crossing the line from Serve into Take.

*Why This Is Dangerous*

If you’re supposed to be in *Serve/Accept*, and you shift into *Take*, then:

- You’ve *broken the implicit agreement*
- The client may drop into the *shadow side of Allow* (enduring)
- The whole dynamic becomes untrustworthy

Let’s look at the *shadow dynamics* of each quadrant.
