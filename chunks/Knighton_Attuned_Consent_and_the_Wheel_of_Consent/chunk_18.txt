### Loving Awareness

**Emma Knighton:**
There’s a mantra you may have heard:

> *"I am loving awareness."*

That’s from *Ram Dass*.

It’s not just a nice phrase. It’s a *practice* for holding psychedelic space.

To hold yourself in loving awareness means:
- Staying connected to your Self
- Radiating presence
- Being clear in your boundaries
- Remaining open without dissolving

> Can you say more about that?

**Emma Knighton:**
Yes.

Attunement *is* risky. It means you are opening. You are letting yourself feel with another.

And when we do that:
- We risk *over-identifying*
- We risk *losing boundaries*
- We risk *merging* instead of meeting

So, someone needs to hold the boundary—and that’s *you*.

You have to know how to regulate yourself while attuning.

You have to know when to *step in* and when to *center yourself again*.
