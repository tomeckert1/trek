### Trauma-Attuned Consent: Core Ideas

**Emma Knighton:**
It’s not just “trauma-informed consent.”  
It’s *trauma-attuned* because:
- It’s *moment-to-moment*
- It’s *alive*
- It’s *embodied*

Consent is not something we do once.  
It is a living, ongoing process that happens *throughout* a relationship—especially when psychedelics are involved.

This approach is *centered on negotiation*.  

We *co-create* agreements with clients, rooted in:
- *Desires* – What do we want?  
- *Limits* – What are our boundaries?  
- *Risks* – What are the inherent dangers?

### A Note on Risk

**Emma Knighton:**
In our trauma-informed care session, we talked about the idea of *“safe enough.”*

Let’s revisit that.

There is *inherent risk* in psychedelic work.  
We cannot guarantee what will arise in a journey.

Our role is to help create conditions that are *safe enough* for the client to say:
> “Yes, I consent to this experience. I know there’s risk. I trust myself and my facilitator enough to proceed.”

It’s not about promising safety.  

It’s about defining the *limits and needs* required for someone to *feel safe enough* to do this risky thing.

### Grappling with Harm and Power

**Emma Knighton:**
This framework helps us engage with a few difficult but important truths:
- We *can* harm one another.  
- Our *clients* carry stories of harm (their own and their ancestors’).  
- These stories can and *will* emerge in deeply vulnerable settings.

So this is an attempt—a map—for how to respond to that reality and create *safer* (not safe) spaces for healing.
