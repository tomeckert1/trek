### Catching Ourselves in Take

**Emma Knighton:**
So what do we do?

We *practice knowing what Take feels like*.  
So when we start to slip toward it, we can say:

> “Wait. This is for me. I need to check myself.”

We pause.  
We track our motivations.  
And we come back into *Serve*.

### Clarifying the Roles

**Student:**
You mentioned moving from Serve to Take... Is there such a thing as moving from Serve to Allow?

**Emma Knighton:**
Good question. Not really.  
Here’s why:
- Serve and Take are both *active roles* (the person doing the thing)  
- Allow and Accept are both *receptive roles* (the person receiving the thing)

As a facilitator, you are always in either *Serve* or (unintentionally) *Take*.  

Because of the power dynamic, you’re the one doing.  
The client is in either *Accept* or (unfortunately, if consent breaks) *Allow*.

### Additional Clarification

**Student:**
What are the shadow sides of Serve and Accept?

**Emma Knighton:**
Yes—great question.

- *Shadow of Serve* is martyrdom.  
  You give and give without boundaries.  
  You may give from a place of needing something back.

- *Shadow of Accept* is entitlement.  

**Emma Knighton:**
  Expecting others to serve you without reciprocity or gratitude.

These shadows aren’t always obvious, but they’re important to track.
