### The Signature of the Self

**Emma Knighton:**
Each of us has a kind of *signature* to who we are when we feel most at home in ourselves.

That “home” energy is:
- Centered  
- Resourced  
- Grounded  
- Compassionate  
- Maybe playful, maybe still  
- Maybe quiet, maybe expressive

And that’s what I want you to bring into your work.

### Why This Matters

**Emma Knighton:**
This exercise brings you into your *capital-S Self*—what IFS calls Self-energy.  
Or, in Polyvagal Theory terms, your *ventral vagal state*.

It’s the version of you that is:
- Relaxed  
- Regulated  
- Centered  
- Able to hold others without getting pulled in  
- Rooted and responsive

### Student Reflection:

**Student:**
When you accept yourself fully, you give others permission to be themselves too.

**Emma Knighton:**
Yes.  
That resonance—it’s real.  
You model that for your clients just by being in your Self.

**Frank:**
I live really big—like Tessa.  
But the last time I was really in my Self was in a moment with a friend who had just finished breast cancer treatment.  
We looked into each other’s eyes at a party, and there was this whole communication that happened just through presence.  
It was deep. Beautiful.

**Emma Knighton:**
Yes. That’s full presence.  
That’s *attunement*—what I want to talk about next.
