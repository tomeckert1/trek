### The Neuroscience of Connection

**Emma Knighton:**
This is where *limbic resonance* and *mirror neurons* come in:
- Our *limbic systems* (emotional brains) sync with one another through proximity, tone, expression, and breath.
- Our *mirror neurons* fire in response to what we perceive in others—helping us feel what they feel.
- Our *breath synchronizes* when we’re attuned—sometimes without us realizing.

This is not metaphorical. It’s real. It’s *embodied interconnection*.

### Tracking Both Worlds: Two-Channel Awareness

In psychedelic space, you must track *two channels* at once:
1. Your *client’s state*
2. Your *own nervous system*

This is essential.

You are not a passive witness. You are a co-regulator.

So ask yourself:
- How am I doing right now?
- Am I grounded?  
- Can I regulate myself if my client becomes overwhelmed?

### Student Insight:

**Student:**
So this is about expanding our capacity—so we can be present with someone and *also* track our own state?

**Emma Knighton:**
Yes, exactly.

You are building *dual awareness*.  
That’s what allows you to *stay in the room*, even when things get intense.

### Practical Implications for Facilitation

**Emma Knighton:**
When you’re working with a client:
- Stay connected to your own body.
- Track their breath, tone, posture.
- Notice if your breath synchronizes with theirs.
- If they dysregulate, notice your own system: are you tightening, withdrawing, over-functioning?

You’re not just holding space.  
> You *are* the space.

### Closing Check-In

**Emma Knighton:**
Before we take a break, I want to ask:

*What’s landing for you right now?*

What did you take from this exploration of attunement, presence, and dual awareness?

**Student (Reflection):**

> The water imagery really stayed with me.
>
> Baths are how I regulate. I had a memory of a sweat lodge where I couldn’t move until I imagined water flooding in—and then I could move freely.
>
> This gave me a tool to return to.

**Emma Knighton:**
Maybe bring a bowl of water to session. Seriously.  
That kind of symbolic or sensory anchor can be powerful.

**Student:**
> I feel electric.

**Emma Knighton:**
Thank you.

I hope this all feels practical.

Sometimes we’re not in open, receptive presence. Sometimes, we’re in *direct action*.

That’s the moment when:
- A client is trying to bolt
- A boundary is being crossed
- Something immediate needs to be done

That’s a *different energy* than presence and attunement.  
It’s still loving. But it’s *directive*.

So I want to empower you:  
> Sometimes we *do* need to act. And that’s okay.
