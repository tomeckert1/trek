### Facilitator Responsibility

**Emma Knighton:**
As the person giving the gift (in *Serve*), you are responsible for:

- *Tracking your own boundaries*
- *Expressing your own needs*
- *Taking care of yourself* so your client doesn’t have to

This is part of the gift.  

**Emma Knighton:**
And I recommend *saying this to your clients* at the beginning of the session:

> “I’ll take care of myself during our time together. You don’t need to take care of me. I’ll let you know if I need anything.”

Clients often have internal parts that *track others’ needs*, even in altered states.  
When we say this explicitly, it helps their system relax.

They can receive the support more fully, because they’re not subconsciously trying to manage us.

### Practicing Consent Through the Body

**Emma Knighton:**
As you engage in this practice, I want you to really *feel into your body*:
- What is it like to ask for something you want?
- What happens in your system when you’re in the *Take* role?
- What happens when you’re in the *Allow* role?
- Are there parts of you that want to please or freeze?
This isn’t just about learning a model.  
This is about building *body-based fluency* in how consent lives, shifts, and sometimes gets lost in real-time.
