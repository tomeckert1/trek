### Compliance vs. Consent Culture

**Emma Knighton:**
You also brought up *pacing*, and that’s huge.

We live in a *compliance culture*, not a consent culture.  
Consent culture would have:
- more *pauses*
- more *space* to find our yes or no
- less urgency to respond quickly

But in this society, we’re expected to answer fast—without a chance to do a deep dive into our true response.

So as psychedelic practitioners, we must *practice slowing down*.  
And we often need to *slow our clients down*—they’re used to fast-consent environments too.

### Why Start with Ourselves?

**Emma Knighton:**
The first part of this class is about your relationship with consent—in your own body.  

The second part will be about how we apply that with clients.

Why start here?

Because most of us are trained in *compliance*, not consent.

If we want to create *consensual relationships* with clients, we must have:
- a *consensual relationship with ourselves*, and  
- a *consent-based relationship with them*

As someone raised in this society and in this body, I’ve been trained in many ways that my *no doesn’t matter*.  
I’ve also been trained to say yes to a lot of things.  
And many of us have learned *people-pleasing* as survival.

So we must understand what we’re bringing into the room—because *it will come out*.  
Especially in psychedelic space, where:
- the boundaries are more porous
- people are suggestible
- vulnerability is heightened

Whatever patterns we have around consent—they’ll show up.  
And *so will your client’s*.

So before we talk about consent with clients, we need to focus on how it lives in your own body.

Make sense?
