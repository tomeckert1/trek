### The Four Questions for Consent Agreements

**Emma Knighton:**
Let’s talk about how we make *consensual agreements* using the Wheel of Consent. There are four essential questions we ask whenever we’re negotiating consent—especially for touch.

Even if you don’t go through each question formally during a session, I want you to *start holding these in the back of your mind* whenever you're in interaction with clients.

The Four Questions

1. *What is happening?*  
   - This is where negotiation happens.  

**Emma Knighton:**
   - What does the client want? What are the boundaries and limits on both sides?  
   - What’s being agreed upon?

2. *Who is doing the action?*  
   - Usually, this is you—the facilitator.

3. *Who is it for?*  
   - This is *the most important question*.  

**Emma Knighton:**
   - Every time you feel the impulse to offer something, pause and ask yourself:  
     > “Who is this for?”  
   - If the answer is “me,” then you’re in *Take*, not Serve.  
   - That doesn’t make it wrong—but you need to *pause*, check in, and possibly reorient.

4. *When or how will it stop?*  
   - This part gets missed all the time.

**Emma Knighton:**
   - Without a clear stop point, clients can slide into *Endure*.

   Example:
   - If I’m holding someone’s hand, and they want to stop but don’t know how, they might keep holding it just to avoid awkwardness.
   - That’s *Endure*.  
   - And then they might perceive me as being in *Take*, even if that wasn’t my intent.

So we need clear agreements about how to stop.
