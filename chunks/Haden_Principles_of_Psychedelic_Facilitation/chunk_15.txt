**Mark Haden:**
### Behaviors to Avoid
- *Telling people who they are*
- *Insisting on interpretation or psychoanalysis*
- *Believing your insight is more valid than the participant’s*
- *Trying to dissolve someone’s ego for them* — that’s not your job
- *Crossing professional boundaries*
- *Leaving before a participant is ready to go*

These behaviors can cause harm. They have no place in good facilitation.

### Integration Support

**Mark Haden:**
After the session, support participants with:
- *Processing negative or destabilizing feelings*
- *Making meaning*: “What did you learn?” “What’s changing for you?”
- *Healthy connection-building*: Who do you want to talk to now? Who *don’t* you want to talk to?

Ask:
> “How did your conversations go afterward?”  
> “Did you feel understood? Misunderstood?”

Be prepared to help them *make sense* of a powerful, confusing, or even isolating experience.

Integration is where much of the actual healing happens.

### Ongoing Development as a Guide

**Mark Haden:**
To do this well over time, you need to:
- Commit to ongoing training
- Invest in relationships with colleagues
- Be willing to *be challenged*
- Keep reflecting on your own blind spots and reactions
- Never assume you’ve “arrived”

Being a psychedelic guide means you’re *always becoming*.

### One or Two Guides?

**Mark Haden:**
You don’t *have* to work with a co-guide under Oregon regulations, but I *strongly recommend* having two people in the room.

Why?
- *Safety:* If something goes wrong, you’re not alone.
- *Witnessing:* Two guides can verify what happened and support each other if a participant accuses someone of misconduct.
- *Self-regulation:* Guides get triggered too. Having a colleague to debrief with is invaluable.
- *Logistics:* Everyone needs to eat and use the restroom.

And if you’re a woman sitting for a male participant, consider never doing so alone. That’s a personal policy I developed after a close call. Always have a male colleague on the premises at minimum.

### Video Recording Sessions

**Mark Haden:**
Video recording can be a powerful protective and educational tool.

Pros:
- Evidence in case of accusations
- Clients may want to watch part of their session for integration
- Trainers can use footage to teach

Guidelines:
- *Never give clients the footage*
- Let them view it only with you present
- *Be clear and explicit* in your consent forms:
  - Who has access?
  - How will it be stored?
  - When will it be destroyed?
  - Will it be used for training?

Transparency protects everyone.

### Outdoor Sessions

**Mark Haden:**
Can you do sessions outdoors?

Yes—but only at a service center with a designated outdoor space.

Considerations:
- Weather (sun, rain, wind)
- Distractions (insects, noise, strangers)
- Safety (contained, supervised environment)

Nature can be beautiful. Connection to land can be profound. But outdoor settings must still allow for *internal work*.

Tips:
- Zero-gravity chairs or mats
- Headphones and eye masks
- Facilitators available to gently guide participants back inward if needed

*Post-peak outdoor time* can be lovely—for grounding and integration. But the *core* of the journey is best done internally.

### Group vs. Solo Work

We’ll discuss group work more in a future module.

For now, know this: group sessions are *very different* from solo ones.

Indigenous traditions often rely on group ceremony—but these are tightly held communal containers. In Western contexts, especially when tied to diagnoses or confidentiality expectations, solo work may be more appropriate.

Still, there’s much to be learned from both. Keep asking: what serves this participant best?
