### Transference and Projection

**Mark Haden:**
You must understand the dynamics of *transference* and *projection*. It happens a lot in this work.

Participants will project unconscious material onto you. You might become their mother, father, sister, child—whatever is unresolved within them. That’s normal.

If a participant yells at you because they see you as their mother, it’s not your failure. It’s part of the process.

Normalize this possibility beforehand if appropriate, and certainly debrief it afterward. Otherwise, participants may leave confused or ashamed by what happened.

If you don’t understand transference, it will be hard to navigate the intense interpersonal dynamics that can arise.

### Trauma and Triggers

**Mark Haden:**
Most people have trauma, and psychedelics often bring it up.

Trauma can manifest as:
- Emotional flashbacks
- Intrusive thoughts
- Physical sensations
- Triggered responses to innocuous events

You might see someone reacting as if they’re back in a battlefield, even though they’re lying in a safe room. That’s a trauma flashback.

The key is to respond with *presence*, not necessarily words.

### Types of Eye Contact

**Mark Haden:**
Even eye contact matters:
- *Direct Gaze:*  
  Nose-to-nose eye contact, very intense. Can be powerful if used intentionally.
- *Soft Gaze:*  
  Looking slightly down and off to the side. It communicates presence without intensity. Often preferable in psychedelic space.

Demonstrate both types to participants in advance so they know what to expect. Some may request eye contact later on, but it’s important they understand the impact of each type.

### Nonverbal Communication

**Mark Haden:**
Much of your presence is communicated through *nonverbal* signals:
- Open hands, uncrossed arms
- Calm breathing
- Relaxed posture

These subtle cues matter more than language in psychedelic space. Language often breaks down. Nonverbal presence becomes your primary form of communication.
