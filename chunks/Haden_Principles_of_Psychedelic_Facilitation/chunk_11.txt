### Therapeutic Alliance

**Mark Haden:**
The bond between guide and participant is one of the strongest predictors of outcome.

You must build trust. If you haven’t successfully built trust, I strongly suggest *not* proceeding with the session.

You can even ask directly:
> “How does it feel to be with me?”  
> “Do you trust me in this space?”

If the participant doesn’t feel safe, the risk of a destabilizing experience goes up significantly.

### Brain Connectivity and the fMRI Image

**Mark Haden:**
You’ve probably seen this image: the psilocybin brain vs. the normal brain from David Nutt’s fMRI research. It shows new connections lighting up all over the place under the influence of psilocybin.

- On the left: a normal brain. The visual cortex mostly talks to itself.
- On the right: a brain on psilocybin. The visual cortex is communicating with many other regions.

This helps explain phenomena like, *“I can see the music.”* It’s a beautiful illustration of expanded connectivity.

But this image can also be misleading.

Some participants may see it and believe that psilocybin will “rewire” their brain and *fix* them—like dropping off a car at the mechanic. That belief is actually predictive of a poor outcome.

Psychedelics don’t fix you. They give you choices. The *real* change happens in the integration process, when you act on what was revealed.

### Preparation Sessions: Agreements and Ground Rules

**Mark Haden:**
In prep sessions, we begin by clarifying the participant’s *intentions*.

Then, go over three fundamental rules:
1. *No sexual touching.*
2. *Do not leave the space.*  
   Define the space clearly—e.g., session room, bathroom, garden. Take keys. Lock up cell phones. Don’t assume people will remember agreements mid-journey.
3. *No harm is done.*  
   No destruction of objects. Intensity is welcome, but breaking things isn’t.

Also discuss:
- *The guides won’t leave you.*  
  You’ll never be left alone.
- *Build a personal altar.*  
  Let participants bring meaningful photos or objects. They may engage with these during the session, and that can be deeply significant.
- *Empty stomach.*  
  Start on an empty stomach. Vomiting may happen, and a full stomach makes it worse.
- *Relaxation technique.*  

  Teach them long, slow, deep breathing as a resource they can use if things get turbulent.

- *Post-session support.*  
  Ensure they have someone to support integration—either within your center or externally.

- *Normalize post-trip turbulence.*  
  Feeling “crazy” the next day is okay. Let them know it might happen.

- *Avoid big life changes immediately.*  

No quitting jobs or divorcing spouses right after a session. Let things settle.

### Managing Emotional Expression

**Mark Haden:**
- *Provide tissues and pillows.*
- *All emotions are welcome.* Crying, laughing, shaking—it’s all okay.
- *Help them express emotions safely.*

### Eliminate Interruptions

**Mark Haden:**
- Turn off phones, computers, and anything that might beep.
- Lock devices away with car keys.
- Plan *how they’ll get home*. No driving post-session.

### Fear of the “Unknown Monster”

**Mark Haden:**
Many participants worry they’ll encounter something terrible hidden in their psyche. That fear is common.

Ask questions like:
> “What are you afraid of?”  
> “What are you hoping for?”  

Let them name it. If they do, normalize it: *That’s very common.* *You’re not alone.*

### Confidentiality

**Mark Haden:**
Participants become deeply vulnerable. Without clear assurances of confidentiality, they may feel shame or fear after the session.

Be explicit: *This stays here. Nothing leaves the room.* Let that land deeply.

### The Canoe Analogy

**Mark Haden:**
Here’s an image that came to me during an Ayahuasca ceremony.

Being on a psychedelic journey is like *canoeing down a canyon*:

- Once you push off, there’s *no turning back*. The only way out is downriver, through time.
- The *wind* is like the set and setting—it shapes the journey.
- You have a *paddle*, which represents *choice*. You can steer around obstacles. You don’t have to crash into every rock.
- If you hit whitewater and get thrown from the canoe, your *life jacket* is your breathing technique. It keeps you afloat until you can regroup.

Let this image guide how you support others: help them navigate, but don’t steer for them. They are the paddler. You are the witness.

### Incremental Experiences and Preparation Tools

**Mark Haden:**
If someone is new to psychedelics, it's helpful to offer *incremental experiences*:
- *Breathwork* is a powerful tool.  
  In my book, I describe a breathwork technique combined with a strobing flashlight placed 18 inches above the face. It produces fractal visuals and intense emotional responses—very psychedelic.

  This helps participants:
  - Get a taste of altered states.
  - Learn how to stay still and surrender.
  - Practice lying down and breathing calmly during intensity.

- *Gradual dosing strategies* may also be useful:  
  Small doses over multiple sessions, slowly building comfort and capacity.

### Verbal Support in Session

**Mark Haden:**
When someone is deep in their process, *very simple communication* is best.

Examples:
- "I'm with you."  
- "You're not alone."  
- "Trust."  
- "Go with the flow."  
- "If you see a door, open it."

Keep your tone slow, grounded, and soft. In fact, *tone is more important than words*.

I used to teach hypnotherapy and would demonstrate this. Saying “relax” with a calm tone is more effective than saying “oranges and bananas” in a soothing voice. The body responds to *tone*, not meaning.
