### Inner Healing Intelligence

**Mark Haden:**
The concept of the *inner healing intelligence* has been around for a while and is incredibly helpful. Stan Grof developed the idea, and Michael and Annie Mithoefer expanded it within the MAPS framework.

This concept tells us that healing comes from *within* the participant, not from the guide. It’s crucial to empower participants to believe *they* are the healer.

If a participant believes they’re in the presence of a “great healer,” it can cause problems. Healing needs to come from within. The role of the guide is to *witness* and *support* the participant’s inner healer.

This isn’t uncommon in medicine. Think of a parent tending to a child with a cut. The parent provides comfort and support, but the child’s body does the healing. It’s the same in this work.

### Unlearning as Part of Training

**Mark Haden:**
This model is very different from traditional talk therapy. For example, CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) often involves lots of questions and structured engagement.

Psychedelic therapy doesn’t work that way.

Some people with lots of credentials come into this work and have *more* to unlearn. They believe they are the fixer, the healer. They need to *unlearn* those instincts to be effective psychedelic guides.

### Summary of the Guide’s Role

**Mark Haden:**
If I were to summarize the guide’s role in one sentence, it would be this:

> The role of the guide is to attend to the needs—physical, personal, and interpersonal—of the participant while creating an atmosphere of stability, compassion, and safety, *while avoiding* caretaking, fixing, labeling, psychoanalysis, diagnosing, or being distracted.

That’s a dense sentence, but if I had to choose only one slide to share with you today, that would be it.
