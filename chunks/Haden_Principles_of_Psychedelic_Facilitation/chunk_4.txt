### Set, Setting, and Matrix

**Mark Haden:**
You’ve all heard of “set and setting,” but there was an author who added something else: *matrix*.

- *Set* refers to the participant’s mindset—their beliefs, hopes, fears, personality, cultural background, and expectations.
- *Setting* is not just the experience room. It can also include the interview room and everything someone experiences when they walk into the building.
- *Matrix* refers to the environment to which the participant returns after the session. People return from sessions vulnerable and open. If they go back to an abusive or mocking home environment, they’re going to have a problem.

So being vigilant about *set, setting,* and *matrix* is very, very important.

### Guiding Setup Example

**Mark Haden:**
Here’s a setup picture from my book. It’s myself, my wife, and a guy from the gym who always wanted to be an actor—we got him to play the role.

The participant is lying down with a blanket, headphones, and eyeshades. He’s relaxed and having what we call an *internal experience*. But he still wants contact, and in this case, he’s holding my hand.

The environment is comfortable and relaxed. There’s art, a Buddha, red roses (which are traditional), and both guides are fully present. Even though the participant is internal, the guides are not off checking email—they’re focused. They do not deviate their attention.

This image tries to capture a lot of what should happen during a psychedelic session.

### Environment Considerations

**Mark Haden:**
- *Soundproofing:* Sessions can be loud. Think about walls, doors, windows. You don’t want neighbors hearing someone screaming.
**Mark Haden:**
- *Private Bathroom:* Crucial. You don’t want participants walking down a hallway to a public restroom.
- *Lighting:* Dimmable lighting is important. Avoid overhead fluorescents. Use soft lighting—ideally, warm, indirect light.
- *Decor:* Tranquil and beautiful. Nature imagery—eagles flying, waterfalls, balancing rocks. You want to foster harmony, relaxation, and a sense of safety.

### Rituals and Personal Altars

**Mark Haden:**
Rituals have pros and cons. They can create a container of safety and help personalize the space. Encourage people to build a personal altar—photographs, meaningful objects. This can help focus intention and create emotional significance.

If you've experienced Ayahuasca ceremonies, you'll notice responses to emotional processes come through *music*, not words. Language often fails in psychedelic space—words are interpreted differently. So music becomes the appropriate response. Shamans do this beautifully.

Even things like *gongs* can signal changes in the process. If you ring a bell when a transition happens, it can become a helpful ritual marker.

But rituals must resonate with the participant. Calling in ancestors might feel meaningful to some and ridiculous to others. So always be flexible.
