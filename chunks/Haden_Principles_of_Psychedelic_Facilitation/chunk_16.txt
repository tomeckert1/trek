### Final Thoughts on Bad Trips

**Mark Haden:**
Some say, “There’s no such thing as a bad trip.”

But I disagree.

Yes, most challenging trips can become transformative—*if* well-supported. But some experiences *are* traumatic. I had one myself in an Ayahuasca ceremony, and it took months of integration to heal from it.

We shouldn’t gaslight people by denying their pain.

Yes:
- Psychedelics are powerful healing tools.
- Most difficult trips become meaningful.

And also:
- *Bad trips exist.*
- *We must be prepared.*
- *Our job is to reduce risk and support integration, no matter what happens.*

This is a historical moment, folks. You’re helping shape the future of psychedelic care. Thank you.
