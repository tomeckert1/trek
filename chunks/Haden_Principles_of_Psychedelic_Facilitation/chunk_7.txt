### Theories of the Psyche in Psychedelic Work

**Mark Haden:**
Understanding the human mind through different theoretical lenses is helpful in this work. You’ll notice that various models—though different—can all manifest in psychedelic space.

- *Stanislav Grof’s Perinatal Matrices:*  
  These describe stages of birth: floating in the womb, being compressed in the birth canal, emerging into the world. All of these can show up during psychedelic sessions.

- *Jungian Archetypes:*  
  Archetypal experiences—like encountering the Wise Old Woman, the Hero, or the Shadow—are common. Knowing these patterns helps with interpretation.

- *Neuroscience Models:*  
  The suppression of the default mode network (DMN) and the emergence of new connectivity networks explains the ego-dissolution and flexible thinking often seen on psychedelics.

- *Chris Bache’s Work:*  
  His book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, is one of the few I consider essential. He took high doses of LSD over decades, picked up where he left off each time, and documented a beautiful, linear journey.

### Janis Phelps’ Six Core Competencies

**Mark Haden:**
I’m a big fan of Janis Phelps from CIIS. She outlined six core competencies for psychedelic therapists. Let’s review a few:

1. *Empathic Abiding Presence*  
   You must deeply resonate with someone’s experience and *stay there* with them for a long time. Presence means they feel your empathy and your groundedness.

2. *Trust Enhancement*  
   Trust-building starts the moment you meet someone. In fact, research shows people begin judging trustworthiness within seconds of first contact.

3. *Spiritual Intelligence*  
   You should understand concepts like *oceanic boundlessness*. Much of psychedelic experience is ineffable—words fail. Having your own experiences helps you interpret others’ mumblings and metaphors.

4. *Self-Awareness and Ethical Integrity*  
   Be able to notice and talk about your own triggers. Know your projections. Own your transference and countertransference. And hold ethical boundaries tightly. Know what’s okay and what’s not.

5. *Knowledge of Medicines*  
   Know the pharmacology, the timelines, the subjective effects, and how they differ across substances.

6. *Complementary Techniques*  
   In MAPS, therapists are expected to have “proficiency in complementary techniques,” though this is loosely defined. Be transparent about the tools and approaches you bring, and talk to your colleagues about it.
