### Physical Touch and Boundaries

**Mark Haden:**
Touch is one of the riskiest areas in this work.

Even simple touch—like hand-holding—needs to be discussed and demonstrated in advance. Here's the correct approach:
- *Offer, don’t initiate.* You might hold out your hand. If the client reaches back, great. If not, don’t push it.
- *Be explicit.* Clearly state that there will be *no sexual touch*—ever.
- *Debrief any touch afterward.* Did it feel supportive? Was there discomfort?

Some clients will want more touch than you are able or willing to offer. In those cases, I suggest keeping a large teddy bear in the room. Offer it to the client for hugging, spooning, whatever. It works remarkably well, and teddy bears don’t file complaints.

Here’s the Oregon regulatory language Tom shared with me:

> “Facilitators may provide supportive touch during administration sessions with prior written consent. Supportive touch is limited to the facilitator placing their hands on the client’s hand or shoulder. A facilitator shall not use other forms of touch nor permit another person to use any other forms of touch during an administration session.”

This clarity is essential. It helps keep the train on the track.
