### Routes of Administration and Session Styles

**Mark Haden:**
You’ll primarily be working with psilocybin, and that’s important to understand. Different psychedelics result in different kinds of sessions:

- *Psilocybin and LSD:*  
  These are mostly *internal* medicines. The participant is typically lying down with eyeshades and headphones, in a deeply inward-facing state.

- *MDMA:*  
  This is more balanced—partly internal, partly interactive. Participants may be lying down at times, but also sitting up and engaging.

- *3-MMC and others:*  
  These tend to be more *external*—more conversation, more movement.

So, if someone has had a prior psychedelic experience that was more social or interactive, they might need orientation. With psilocybin, the default is inward, eyeshades on, headphones on.
