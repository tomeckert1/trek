### Session Endings and Turbulence

**Mark Haden:**
As the session closes (after 6–8 hours), some participants may still feel turbulent.

At this point, you have two options:
1. *Go deeper to resolve.*  
   Re-engage with what’s unresolved and support its completion.

2. *Redirect or move on.*  
   Offer food, juice, or a reflective conversation. Ask, “What was that like for you?”

Make this decision consciously. Both are valid, depending on the participant and the moment.

Offer tools for *integration*:
- A video on gratitude.
- Art supplies for drawing the experience.
- Language that places the session in *past tense*, helping them transition.

Ask:
> “How are you feeling now?”  
> “What stands out from your journey?”
