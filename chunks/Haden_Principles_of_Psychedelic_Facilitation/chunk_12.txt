### Boundaries and Safety

**Mark Haden:**
Sometimes participants try to leave the space. You must memorize boundary-setting phrases:
> "We made an agreement not to leave the space."  
> "You’re safe here."  
> "Let’s stay right here together."

Repeat these calmly. Stay grounded.

*Bathroom support*:  
Some participants are unsteady. You may need to:
- Let them hold your arm.
- Let them place their hands on your shoulders and follow you (in tow).
- Stand outside the bathroom door and escort them back.

*Vomiting*:  
Be prepared. Have a lined bucket nearby. Tie it up discreetly. Replace it seamlessly. This should be part of your *session checklist*.

### Emergency Situations

**Mark Haden:**
What if there’s a *fire alarm*?
- Know the evacuation plan.
- Know the nearest park or safe outdoor location.
- Have a clear agreement with your staff.
- Practice this mentally beforehand.

*Never improvise in the moment.*

### Sexual Behavior

**Mark Haden:**
We’ll talk more about this in future sessions, but here’s the bottom line:

If someone expresses sexual behavior:
- Respond with calm, clear statements.
- “This is not what we do here.”  
- “There is no sexual touch in this space.”  
- “We keep our clothes on.”

Repeat gently, without judgment. Be clear, grounded, and firm.

You must *plan in advance* how to handle this. Don’t improvise. Think through your boundaries now and rehearse your language.
