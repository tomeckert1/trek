### Introduction

**Jason Foster:**
And with that, I'd like to introduce Mark.

Mark has an MSW from UBC. He was the Executive Director of MAPS Canada for ten years. He’s published on the issue of drug control policy and psychedelics in multiple professional journals, and he was awarded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal for drug policy reform work in 2013. I don't know what that is, but it sounds pretty cool. So welcome, Mark. Please, take it away.

**Mark Haden:**
Thank you, Jason. I'd like to just start by saying how thrilled I am to be here.

It's both a thrill and an honor. I’ve been cheering loudly on the sidelines of the initiative you’ve all been involved with for the past however many years. It seems like decades, but it’s been a long time. And I just applaud Tom and the group for making it happen. Now it actually is happening, and I’m thrilled to be here. This is a historical moment. So I honor and appreciate everyone who stepped up to make this happen. Thank you.

So let’s talk about psychedelic guiding.

It’s all based on my book, which I wrote because I realized that a lot of psychedelic guides have written material, but they don’t often say what they actually *do*. What they tend to share are stories—this happened, that happened—and while there are fascinating stories, nobody ever seems to lay out: *This is how I set somebody up. This is how I ran the session. This is what I did.* This is meant to be helpful in terms of practical guidance and endless checklists.
