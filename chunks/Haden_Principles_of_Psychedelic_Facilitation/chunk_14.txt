### Who Should Be a Guide?

**Mark Haden:**
People sometimes say, “I want to be a guide, but I don’t want to ever take psychedelics myself.”

Personally, I can’t imagine that. I don’t know how someone could truly offer *empathy* in psychedelic space if they’ve never been there themselves.

You don’t have to take psychedelics frequently, but you need to *understand the terrain*. There's nothing else quite like it.

### Challenges of the Work

**Mark Haden:**
Being a guide means being ready for both the *gifts* and the *challenges*:

- Some sessions are deeply beautiful.
- Others are intense, slow, confusing, or draining.
- Sometimes the biggest challenge is boredom.
- Other times, it’s staying grounded in overwhelming intensity.
- You may experience *compassion fatigue* from holding space for difficult emotions over many hours.

This is why working in *teams* is so vital.

### Team-Based Guiding vs. Special Relationships

**Mark Haden:**
This is a topic where I differ from Michael and Annie Mithoefer.

They emphasize *special co-therapist relationships*—working with one partner consistently.

But in my experience, I supervised a *team of therapists* for decades. Everyone worked with everyone. No special pairings.

Why?

Because:
- Special partnerships can become exclusive or enmeshed.
- If something goes wrong in the relationship, it can disrupt the entire practice.
- Team-based approaches allow for more *flexibility, accountability, and support.*

I’ve seen special relationships go sideways. But I’ve also seen team-based models thrive and foster transparency.

If you’re going to do this work long-term, consider committing to *strong team culture* rather than one “go-to” partner.

### Accountability and Transparency

**Mark Haden:**
Being part of a team supports:
- Debriefing after sessions
- Naming your own countertransference
- Recognizing your projections
- Getting support when something feels off

Most of the problems I saw at MAPS or MAPS Canada could have been prevented through *collaborative accountability*.

You’re never a “finished” guide. You’re always learning. Training is lifelong.
