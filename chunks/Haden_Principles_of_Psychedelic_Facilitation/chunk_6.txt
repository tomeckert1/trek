### Qualities of a Guide

**Mark Haden:**
1. *Discernment in Action*  
   A good guide has the experience, knowledge, and wisdom to understand when *not* to act.

   In the MAPS training, we watched hours of video of Michael and Annie Mithoefer facilitating. Every once in a while, the video would be paused, and the trainers would ask: “What would you do now?”

   Everyone would offer suggestions. And then we’d be told—very compassionately—we were all wrong.

   The correct answer was: *Do nothing.* Be there. Witness. Stay present. That’s what was needed.

2. *Calm in the Face of Emotion*  
   You must stay relaxed and grounded when faced with fear, anxiety, and turbulent emotions.

   Old literature—like papers from the Leary group—showed that when things went wrong, it was usually because *the guide* became ungrounded.
   Psychedelics are empathogenic. Even psilocybin. If the guide is panicking, the participant will *feel it*. Calmness is vital.

3. *Pharmacological Knowledge*  
   Understand the medicine. When it starts, when it peaks, how it wanes. You need to know what’s happening in someone’s body and mind.

4. *Trust*  
   Trust the process. Trust the medicine. Trust the participant’s inner healer.

   Trust is contagious. When you radiate trust, participants feel it and begin to trust themselves and the process, too.
