### Illness and Healing

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
The Mazatec view illness as an *imbalance in relationship* — either with:
- Another person
- Nature
- Invisible forces

Healing, then, is about *restoring balance*. This may involve repentance or offerings — actions to realign with the greater whole. A *prayer*, a *candle*, or an *offering to a mountain* may be used to signify this restoration.

### Vertical Dimension: The Three Realms

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
The altar also symbolizes the *vertical axis* of reality:
- *Upper world* – realm of the gods and saints  
- *Middle world* – our human realm, including invisible spirits  
- *Underworld* – the realm of the dead and of recycling energy

Some elements on the altar are placed *above* to represent the divine. Others are placed *beneath the table*, such as bowls of water or stones, to signify the *underworld*.

Death is not viewed as a punishment but as *part of the cycle* of purification and rebirth. After death, one’s energy may return as a *plant, animal, or purified soul* ready to ascend.
