### Q&A: Mazatec Lineage and the Red Book

**Simon Yugler:**
Thank you so much, Mario. There are a bunch of questions coming in. Let's start with one from *Nick Beaton*, who asks about Maria Sabina’s lineage — whether she had teachers or was self-taught.

**Nick Beaton:**
Hi. Thank you — this was really fascinating. It sounds like Maria Sabina didn’t have a teacher, but was instead initiated directly by the mushrooms. Was she guided at all by family members or others?

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Great question, Nick.

As far as I know, Maria Sabina didn’t have formal teachers. What I learned from doing fieldwork with the Mazatec people is that they have a strong culture of *initiation*. The mushrooms themselves are seen as *teachers*. 

Yes, some people learn by observing others, but ultimately, the mushrooms guide the process. One sign of being initiated is having a *vision of a red book*, which symbolizes the transmission of secret knowledge.

Later, I’ll talk about another important symbol — the *silver table* — which plays a big role in how sacred knowledge is received.

**Simon Yugler:**
I love that the red book is an initiatory symbol. I knew that would speak to you, Simon, since you and I both know the significance of *Carl Jung’s Red Book*, which is full of visionary illustrations and symbolic insights.

### Q&A: Mushroom Strains and Potency

**Simon Yugler:** 
Next question is from *Tamara*, asking what strain of mushrooms Maria Sabina worked with.

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Good question — and a bit complex. Ethnobotanist *Richard Evans Schultes* originally misidentified the species, but later corrected it.

There are three main strains used in Mazatec ceremonies:

- *Rumbe* — or “Landslide Mushrooms,” considered the most potent. They often grow after a thunderstorm causes a landslide.
- *San Isidro* — medium strength.
- *Pajaritos* — “Little Birds,” the mildest variety.

These names reflect traditional taxonomy rather than strict scientific classification.

**Simon Yugler:**
I love that the strongest strain is called "Landslide" — reminds me of modern names like “Head Exploder” or other colorful labels used in cannabis and mushroom circles today.
