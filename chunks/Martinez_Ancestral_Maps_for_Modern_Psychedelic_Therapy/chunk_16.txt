### Honoring Mazatec Artists

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Let me close by pointing to some ways you can *take action* and further explore these ideas.

Many of the beautiful paintings shown in this presentation were created by *Rene Alvarado*, a visionary artist of Mazatec heritage. His artwork reflects sacred imagery, dreamscapes, and elements of entheogenic cosmology.

Rene is a dear friend. I once helped sneak him into a conference where he gifted Alex Grey one of his prints—and Grey was deeply moved. Supporting artists like Rene is a direct way to uplift the culture and people who’ve given so much to this global movement.

### Giving Back to the Mazatec Community

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Here are two *trusted organizations* doing meaningful reciprocity work:

1. *Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative (IRI)* — Chakruna Institute  
   Website: [https://www.chacruna-iri.org](https://www.chacruna-iri.org)

   - Funds go directly to community-led projects in Mazatec regions and beyond.

2. *Nierika Institute*  
   Website: [https://www.nierika.org](https://www.nierika.org)
   - Focused on supporting intercultural research, indigenous voices, and the preservation of sacred traditions.

### Final Thoughts
 
**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:** 
- Recognize the *foundational role* that the Mazatec people—and Maria Sabina—played in the psychedelic renaissance.
- Understand that indigenous cultures are *not static relics*, but evolving, living systems.
- Be open to *bridging* traditions: modern and ancestral, rational and intuitive, personal and communal.

> “Each tradition is a *fragmented image of the whole*. No culture holds all the truth—but together, we can come closer.”
