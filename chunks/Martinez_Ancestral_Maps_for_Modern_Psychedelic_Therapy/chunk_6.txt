### A Mexican Research Initiative

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
In 2020, the first formal research project on psilocybin mushrooms in Mexico was launched — a project I was honored to participate in. It was called:

> *Dialogue of Knowledge about the Therapeutic Potential of Psilocybin Botany Mushrooms*

This was a transdisciplinary initiative, bringing together neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, biology, and *traditional indigenous knowledge*. The goal was to avoid cultural appropriation, honor the principle of *social justice*, and learn from both Western science and indigenous cosmology.

### A Framework for Understanding: Paradigm Comparison

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
To support this effort, I created a framework to compare the paradigms of *Western psychedelic therapy* and *indigenous mushroom ceremony*. This includes differences in:
- *Set and preparation:* In Western settings, this may involve talk therapy and intention setting. In indigenous practice, it may include prayers, rituals, and dietary or sexual abstinence.
- *Substance:* In the West, psilocybin is treated as a molecule. For the Mazatec, mushrooms are seen as living beings — the "niños santos" or "sacred children."
- *Setting:* Western therapy often occurs one-on-one, with music and eye masks. Mazatec ceremonies — called *Veladas* — are conducted in *silence* and *darkness*, with the guidance of a *Shota-shiné* (healer).
- *Facilitation:* Western models lean toward non-directiveness. The Mazatec use chants, prayers, and ritual as active guidance.
- *Integration:* In the West, this may involve journaling or follow-up therapy. For the Mazatec, healing is collective, relational, and cosmological.

### Toward Intercultural Understanding

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
This is not about deciding which approach is “better.” Rather, it’s an invitation to explore how different cosmologies hold healing. It’s about building *intercultural bridges* — and finding what resonates for you.

Let’s pause here. I’d love to hear any questions so far before we go deeper into the Mazatec cosmology.
