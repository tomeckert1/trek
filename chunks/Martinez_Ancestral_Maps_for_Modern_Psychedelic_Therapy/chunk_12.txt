### Syncretism: Catholic and Indigenous Fusion

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Mazatec cosmology is *syncretic* â€” it has absorbed elements of *Catholicism*, such as:
- Images of *Virgin Mary*
- Use of *Catholic prayers* (e.g., *Padre Nuestro*)

However, these are *reinterpreted* in indigenous terms. For example, saints are seen not just as Christian figures but as *archetypal powers* that represent *aspects of nature and spirit*.

One Chjota chine I interviewed shared that the *Virgin Mary* was invoked to help a woman become pregnant. The saint became a *divine intercessor* who could influence physical and spiritual fertility.
