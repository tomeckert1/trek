### Practical Applications

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
1. *Be inspired, not imitative*—don’t replicate indigenous ceremony; learn from it.
2. Consider *intercultural therapy*: bridging indigenous wisdom with modern psychotherapy.
3. Explore your own *ancestry* as part of self-understanding.
4. Relate to the mushroom not just as a molecule but as a *spiritual ally*.
5. Create group rituals or altars that center *gratitude, guidance, and intention*.

### Reflection Questions

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- How does the mushroom experience change when approached as a *sacred entity*?
- What does this worldview teach us about the link between *healing, community, and the sacred*?
- How can we honor and give back to the *indigenous communities* that preserved this knowledge?
- Where do we draw the line between *cross-cultural learning* and *cultural appropriation*?
