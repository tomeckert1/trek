### The Life Magazine Article and the Birth of Psychedelic Tourism

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
When Gordon Wasson met María Sabina, she agreed to guide him through a mushroom ceremony. She allowed him to write about the experience, but she specifically asked that he not mention her name or the location.

He did not honor this request.

Wasson published an article titled *"Seeking the Magic Mushroom"* in *Life Magazine* in 1957, a widely read publication at the time. In it, he described his experiences and named both María Sabina and the town of Huautla de Jiménez.

That same year, 1957, Jack Kerouac published *On the Road*, a foundational text of the Beat Generation — a movement marked by disillusionment with modern American values and a search for deeper meaning. Inspired by Wasson’s article and the cultural ferment of the time, many young Westerners traveled to Huautla de Jiménez in search of mushrooms and mystical experiences.

Soon, Huautla was inundated with hippies, travelers, and seekers — many of whom lacked an understanding of the sacredness of the tradition. Some would walk naked in the streets, smoke cannabis openly, and even engage in sexual activity in public. This cultural clash created profound tension.

### The Consequences for María Sabina

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
The local community blamed María Sabina for the invasion of foreigners. Her house was burned down. One of her children was killed. She became a scapegoat for what they saw as the betrayal of sacred knowledge.

In an interview later in life, María Sabina said:

> “Before, I felt that the holy children, the mushrooms, elevated me.  
> I no longer feel that way.  
> From the moment the foreigners arrived, the holy children lost their purity.  
> They lost their strength.  
> They were decomposed.”
