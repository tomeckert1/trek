### Western Science and the Synthesis of Psilocybin

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
There’s another version of the story, the one told in the West. After Wasson's article, he gave mushroom samples to *Albert Hofmann*, who synthesized *psilocybin* and *psilocin* in a lab. Hofmann later visited María Sabina and brought with him psilocybin pills to see if they had the same effect.

She reportedly said they had the same strength — but there’s a different version of the story from her descendants.

*Julio Glockner*, a respected Mexican anthropologist who worked with María Sabina’s family, reports that she actually said this:

> “Although the pills had the same strength, I preferred not to work with them because the language in which they expressed themselves was English.”

A beautiful metaphor, suggesting that while the effects were similar, the spirit — the relationship — was not the same. The pills didn’t “speak” in her native cosmological tongue.

### Reciprocity and the Origins of Psychedelic Science

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**  
Today, psychedelics are experiencing a renaissance — with *psilocybin* at the forefront of clinical research and psychiatric innovation. But we must remember that this modern science has roots in ancient traditions.

A Brazilian journalist, *Marcelo Leite*, wrote an article titled:

> *"Researchers Demand Reparations to the Mazatec for Mushroom Spirit"*

In it, he says:

> “Psychedelics are currently undergoing a renaissance in psychiatry with psilocybin at the forefront.  
> However, this important substance is tainted by original sin.  
> Science has never paid off its historical debt to the Mazatec people of Mexico, who preserved the psychoactive substance for posterity.”

So we must ask ourselves: how do we honor the source of these medicines? How do we engage in reciprocity?
