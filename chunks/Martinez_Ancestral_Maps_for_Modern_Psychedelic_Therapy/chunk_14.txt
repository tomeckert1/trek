### Synthesis: Lessons from Mazatec Cosmology

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Let me now synthesize what we’ve explored and offer some *key lessons* that can inform our own practices and worldviews.

### Interconnectedness and Cosmic Responsibility

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- All beings are *interwoven* in a cosmic fabric.
- We are not isolated; we are *microcosmic reflections* of the whole.
- Every action we take has *cosmic consequences*—what we do to others, to nature, or to unseen forces, we also do to ourselves.

> “Whatever I do to the world, I do to myself.”

### Honoring Ancestors

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- Acknowledging our *ancestry* helps us understand who we are.
- The Mazatec people celebrate their ancestors through rituals and festivities (e.g., dressing as old people and offering life-affirming wisdom in the streets).
- The *ancestral wisdom* of the Mazatec, especially Maria Sabina, is foundational to the global psychedelic movement.

### Reciprocity

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- One must *give back* after receiving healing from mushrooms.
- This is done through *offerings*—cacao, copal, or ritual acts performed at sacred places (e.g., mountains).
- Reciprocity restores *balance* and acknowledges the *gift* received.

### Illness and Healing

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- Illness is not random—it stems from *imbalance in relationship*:
  - With other people
  - With nature
  - With the spiritual world
- Healing requires *recognizing harm*, *restoring balance*, and *acting with consciousness*.

### Myth, Spirit, and the Unconscious

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- The Mazatec speak of *spirits, gods, and saints*.
- These can be seen as symbolic forms of *unconscious forces*—e.g., the god of fire and anger representing repressed rage.
- Myth is a *shared language* that shapes our relationship to the unseen.

### Expanded Notions of Self

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- Personhood extends beyond the individual to include:
  - Community
  - Nature
  - Ancestors
  - Spiritual realms
- Through sacred ceremony, we *rediscover our connectedness*.
