### Mazatec Cosmology and the Velada: Sacred Ceremony

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Let’s now explore a *contemporary ethnography* of Mazatec practices — what they’re actually doing now.

The traditional mushroom ceremony is called the *Velada*. The word comes from *vela*, meaning candle — and *velada* means "vigil" or "night watch." These ceremonies are held at *night* in an enclosed space, usually simple except for the *altar*.

### The Altar

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
At the altar, there are:

- Images of *Catholic saints*
- Many *candles*
- *Sacred objects* arranged with care and symbolism

The *candles are eventually extinguished*. The ceremony is held mostly in *darkness and silence*, which creates a powerful atmosphere for an *inner journey*.

### The Chjota chine (Healer)

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
The *chjota chine* is the healer or ritual guide. If the healer is a woman, she’s called a *Shon Shiné*.

In Western terms, we might say "shaman," though that term originates in Siberia and may not be appropriate here. In the Mazatec context, the healer is a *ritual specialist* who knows how to work with the mushrooms and the spirit world.

### Ceremony as a Bridge

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
The *Velada* is seen as an *intersection* between:
- *Ordinary reality* and  
- The *invisible spiritual realm*

The soul is understood to *travel*, to *fly*, during the mushroom journey. Through *prayers, smudging, and symbolic acts*, the Chjota Chine guides the journey and signals directions to the soul.

This is quite different from Western facilitation, where *music* is constant and *one-on-one* settings are typical. The *Mazatec* ceremonies are *collective* experiences and largely conducted in *darkness and silence*.

### The Altar as a Cosmological Map

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
My research focused on the *symbolism of the altar*. Each Chjota Chine has their own style, but the altars share key elements and represent a *hidden cosmology*.

I propose that the *Mazatec altar is a symbolic map of the cosmos*.

A key vision in initiation is the *Silver Table* — a visionary image seen during a mushroom journey. This table represents the *entire universe*. The Mazatec believe that *Father-Mother God* — not just a fatherly deity — sits at the Silver Table and *shapes reality* from there.

When the Chjota Chine arranges and uses the altar, they are *replicating God’s table of creation*, influencing the world by adjusting elements on this sacred microcosm.

### Dimensions of the Mazatec Altar

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
The altar has *two symbolic dimensions*:

1. *Horizontal dimension* – represents *space and the four directions*
2. *Vertical dimension* – represents the *cosmic realms* (upper world, middle world, underworld)

### Horizontal Dimension: The Four Directions

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
On the flat surface of the altar, objects are arranged to represent:

- *North, South, East, and West*
- The *center*, often marked by a flower, a stone, or a Christian cross

This is a *symbolic compass* — a representation of the universe. The *center* symbolizes the *individual*. During ceremony, aligning oneself with the center means *becoming one with the cosmos*.

The four directions represent aspects of the greater whole. When a person aligns themselves with these, they *reconnect* with nature and community.

The *human being* is seen as a *microcosmic reflection* of the macrocosmic world — a holographic part of the universe.
