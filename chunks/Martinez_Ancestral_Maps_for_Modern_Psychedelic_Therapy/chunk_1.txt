### Opening Remarks

**Simon Yugler:**
Welcome, everyone. I’ll say again for the second time that you're all in for a treat tonight. I'm so happy to be sharing tonight's class with you all and to be moderating this discussion with my dear friend, Oneiros.

Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero, aka Oneiros Speculum — which means *the dreaming mirror* — was born and raised in Mexico. He’s the author of three books in Spanish:

- *Navigating the Sea of Thoughts: An Introduction to Philosophy*  
- *Oneiro Cosmos: A Handbook for Working and Exploring the Universe of Dreams*  
- *Psychedelic Revelations: A Psychonautic Guide for Expanding the Horizons of Consciousness*

He’s a therapist and an expert in dreams and visions, with experience supporting sacred plant ceremonies and guiding psychedelic integration.

He holds a master’s degree in Philosophy of Religion and has complementary training in transpersonal psychology. He’s collaborated with educational and research projects on psychedelics and expanded states of consciousness, including:

- MindSurf: A Mexico-based psychedelic and psychoanalytic education platform  
- Via Synapsis: An academic congress he founded  
- Nido: A Mexican psychedelic care organization (similar to Zendo)  
- NIERICA: An entheogenic research and intercultural therapy center based near Mexico City

**Simon Yugler:**
Oneiros has done fieldwork with the Mazatec people in Oaxaca and researched traditional mushroom ceremonies and indigenous entheogenic cosmology. I just love that phrase — *entheogenic cosmology* — such a beautiful combination of words.

He's also the founder and director of Mexico's first online educational program on entheogens and sacred plants, and he currently offers dreamwork sessions and has a private psychotherapy and integration practice.

I'll also say that Oneiros and I met at his birthday party — was it four years ago? Outside of Tepoztlán, Mexico. The theme was to come dressed as your mythic self. He was dressed as Hermes, the Greek god of mischief and trickery. I’ve always had a soft spot for Hermes and trickster gods, and I knew right then that we’d be long-time friends.

It's such a pleasure to introduce you, mi hermano, Oneiros. Welcome, and thank you for being here.
