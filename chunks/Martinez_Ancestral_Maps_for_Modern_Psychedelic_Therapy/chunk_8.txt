### Q&A: Language of the Pills and Personal Influence

**Simon Yugler:**  
Let’s bring up *Oscar*, who had a really fascinating question.

**Oscar:**
Hi. Sorry — I lost connection for a moment there. I was curious: what did Maria Sabina mean when she said that the *pills spoke in English*? I’ve never heard that before.

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Such a good question. Like many Indigenous cultures, the Mazatec people have unique ways of describing spiritual phenomena.

Maria Sabina reportedly said that the *synthetic psilocybin pills* that *Albert Hofmann* brought her had the *same potency* as the mushrooms, but she *couldn’t understand them* the same way. She said, _“they speak in English.”_

What I think she meant is: they didn’t resonate with her on a spiritual level. The mushrooms — as living beings — communicated in a way she could understand. But the pills, while effective, felt foreign or disconnected.

**Simon Yugler:**
That’s such a powerful image — her relationship with the mushrooms was so intimate, she could *sense a different language* in the synthetic version. A beautiful reflection on her attunement.
