### Cosmological Structure and the Soul’s Journey

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
In Mazatec cosmology, the universe is structured into *three realms* and is encircled by a *symbolic arc*—a *sacred circumference* that holds the cosmos together.

### The Three Realms
**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**

1. *Underworld (Below the Table)*  
   - The domain of the *dead*  
   - Represented by bowls of water, stones, or plants beneath the altar  
   - Not a hellish realm, but a *purification space*  
   - After purification, a soul may return as a plant, animal, or human  
   - If fully purified, the soul may ascend to become a *saint or divine being*

2. *Middle World (The Human Realm)*  
   - Where humans and *invisible spiritual forces* co-inhabit  
   - Includes *spirits of trees, winds, and mountains*

3. *Upper World (Above the Table)*  
   - The realm of *gods, saints, ancestors*  
   - Saints are not seen as separate from God, but as *aspects of divine consciousness*
   - Each saint *specializes* in a domain (e.g., fertility, healing, agriculture)

### Divine Influence and Prayer

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
In ritual, the Chjota chine (ceremonial guide) *prays to specific saints* or energies depending on the desired outcome:
- *Conception or creativity* → prayers to the *East* and to *fertility saints* like the Virgin Mary
- *Releasing or destroying illness* → prayers to the *West* for dissolution and transformation

This is not a dualistic good vs. evil cosmology. Rather, it’s a *cyclical cosmology* of *birth, death, and rebirth*—a *nonlinear understanding of time* and causality.

### The Journey of the Soul

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
During Veladas, it is believed that one’s *soul can travel*:
- To the *seven upper realms (heavens)*  
- Or the *seven lower realms (underworlds)*

Initiates who reach the *highest heaven* are said to receive *sacred knowledge*, often represented symbolically as:
- The *red book*
- The *silver table*

This journey is seen as more than personal—it connects the individual to *ancestral memory*, *cosmic truths*, and *collective healing*.

### Cosmology as Healing Paradigm

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
- Healing is not only about individual psyche, but about *aligning* with *cosmic rhythms*
- Time is *circular*, not linear; mushrooms grant *vision* into what was, is, and will be
- Through mushroom visions, one may *consult ancestors* or *divine beings*
- Illness is a *spiritual imbalance*—healing comes through *reconnection*
