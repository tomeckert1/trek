### The Origin Story of María Sabina

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
María Sabina was born into extreme poverty in Huautla de Jiménez, a condition that sadly persists today in many parts of the region. As a child, she and her sister would play in the forest, and one day, driven by hunger, she found and ate mushrooms — reportedly around sixty pairs.

That’s a massive dose, especially for a child.

She began to experience visions. When her parents found her, she was lying on the ground, speaking with invisible beings. She later said this was her first encounter with the *Niños Santos*, the “holy children” — her name for the mushrooms.

These beings, she said, guided her through the secrets of the universe. Through them, she learned to heal others by channeling the intelligence of nature.

As an adult, she became a *sabia*, the name the Mazatec give to healers who guide mushroom ceremonies, known as *veladas*. She would enter trance states through mushroom ingestion and receive diagnoses of her patients' illnesses. Then she would sing healing songs to guide them through their journeys.

### The Words of María Sabina

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Let me read a quote from María Sabina, describing how she experienced the mushrooms:

> “There is a world beyond ours, a world that is far away, also close and invisible.  
> That is where God lives, where death and the saints live, a world where everything has already happened and everything is known.  
> That world speaks.  
> It has its own language.  
> I report what it says. The sacred mushrooms take me by the hand and lead me to the world where everything is known.”

In these poetic words, we glimpse the Mazatec cosmology — where mushrooms are not just tools, but sentient guides that connect us to an invisible world of knowledge and healing.
