### Q&A: Critiques of Modern Use

**Simon Yugler:**
Let’s bring up *Trevor*, who has a big-picture question.

**Trevor:**
Yeah, Mario. From your perspective, what’s your biggest *critique* of how we’re using mushrooms in American psychedelic healing today?

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Thank you. That’s a deep one.

I think modern facilitation is *very focused on the individual*, often emphasizing *personal biography* and internal trauma.

But Indigenous traditions work on a *broader scale* — connecting the person to *community*, to *cosmic forces*, and to *nature*.

Yes, modalities like *transpersonal psychology* are expanding this, but Indigenous healing offers even wider horizons.

We’ll dive deeper into this soon when I discuss *Mazatec cosmology* and its implications for healing.

**Simon Yugler:**
Beautiful — thank you, Mario.
