### Introduction: Maria Sabina and Mazatec Cosmology

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Thank you so much for those beautiful words and all your support. And actually, thank you to Simon, because it was through him that I was introduced to the people in Portland. Little by little, I became part of this wonderful project, and now you all are too.

This talk is called *“Ancestral Maps for Modern Psychedelic Therapy: Maria Sabina and Mazatec Cosmology.”*

To begin, I want to acknowledge María Sabina, whom I’m sure many of you have heard of. She's the most renowned shaman associated with traditional mushroom ceremonies.

We’ll talk about her legacy and how it relates to modern psychedelic therapy, cosmology, and spiritual practice.

### The Psychedelic Richness of Mexico

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann, Richard Evans Schultes, and others have affirmed that Mexico is one of the richest countries in terms of psychoactive plants, seeds, and mushrooms — I’d say it's top two. There’s an incredible variety of sacred mushrooms and plants — peyote, ololiuhqui, and others — and Mexico is also home to a vast diversity of Indigenous cultures that have used these sacred plants ceremonially for centuries.

This rich cultural soil is the foundation of Indigenous sacred traditions that eventually led to the "discovery" of sacred mushrooms by the West.

However, with the arrival of the Spanish came the Inquisition. Many of these sacred plant and mushroom rituals, ceremonies, and cosmologies were suppressed or destroyed. These traditions either had to go underground or were lost altogether.

Some, however, survived in remote places — in the deserts where the Huicholes (Wixárika) carry out their ceremonies, and in the mountains of Oaxaca, in regions like Huautla de Jiménez, home of the Mazatec people. These areas were difficult to access, so the traditions endured.

In the deep regions of Mexico, an ancient connection between human beings, nature, and spirit — mediated through entheogens — survived colonization and religious suppression.

### Gordon Wasson and the Rediscovery of Mazatec Ceremonies

**Mario Alonso Martinez Cordero:**
When Gordon Wasson came to Mexico and visited these regions, he found these ancient traditions still alive and sought to experience them himself.

Let’s talk briefly about Gordon Wasson and his wife, Valentina Pavlovna. Gordon was a banker, but Valentina had shared with him that in her country, there were long-standing traditions of foraging for edible mushrooms. This intrigued him, especially when he realized that some cultures embraced mushrooms, while others feared them — what they called *mycophobic* versus *mycophilic* cultures.

Together, they helped establish the field of *ethnomycology*, the study of the role fungi have played in culture, myth, and folklore. Wasson studied Siberian shamans who used *Amanita muscaria*, and his research brought him fame in relation to sacred mushroom use.

Richard Evans Schultes, the legendary Harvard ethnobotanist, informed Wasson that there were rumors of ancient mushroom traditions in Mexico — especially among the Mazatec people. And so Wasson went to Oaxaca, to Huautla de Jiménez, where he met María Sabina — already the most respected and prestigious healer using sacred mushrooms at the time.
