### Psychedelics and Early Christianity
 
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
There is some speculation that *Jesus Christ* and his disciples may have used psychedelic mushrooms to receive divine messages and promote their teachings.

While controversial, these theories point to parallels between:
- Jesus' teachings (love, tolerance, unity)
- Common themes experienced during psychedelic journeys

*Possible Eucharist Alterations*

Some researchers suggest early Christian sects—especially the *Gnostics*—may have used *Amanita muscaria* spiked wine in their *Eucharist rituals* as a way to commune directly with the divine.

### Eleusinian Mysteries: Ancient Greek Psychedelia

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
From ~1500 BCE to 392 CE, the *Eleusinian Mysteries* in ancient Greece centered on the use of a sacred drink called *kykeon*, which likely contained *ergot*, a black fungus that grows on rye.

*Ergot contains ergotamine*, a compound that is a chemical precursor to LSD.

*Medical Uses of Ergot*

- Historically used to *stop postpartum hemorrhage* due to its vasoconstrictive effects
- Can be deadly in high doses—causes *gangrene* and *convulsions*

In the Middle Ages, ergotism was known as *"Saint Anthony’s Fire"*, and its symptoms—hallucinations, paranoia, the delusion of flight—led to widespread *witch trials* and executions, particularly targeting *folk healers and women*.
