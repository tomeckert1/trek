### The Fifth Wave: Commercialization, Capitalism, and the Future
*(2010s – Present Day)*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*The Age of Startups, Biotech, and Mainstreaming*
  
We are now in the *Fifth Wave*, marked by the *mainstream acceptance* and *commercialization* of psychedelics.

Key features of this wave:
- *Biotech companies* racing to patent psychedelic molecules
- *Investor interest* and VC-backed psychedelic startups
- *Legal service models* (e.g., Oregon & Colorado)
- Growing interest in *psychedelic retreat centers*

> Psychedelics are now a *billion-dollar industry*—and growing fast.

### Psilocybin’s Cultural Makeover

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Mushrooms aren’t just medicine anymore. They’re *fashion statements*, *eco-symbols*, and *consumer products*.

- Mushroom emojis, decor, and aesthetic
- Mycelium-based clothing
- Fungi as symbols of regeneration and sustainability

Even those outside the psychedelic community are embracing *“shroom chic.”*

### Ethical Tensions in the Fifth Wave

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
This wave is *not without challenges*. As psychedelics become commercialized, we face serious questions:
- Who owns psychedelic medicine?
- What happens to *indigenous knowledge and stewardship*?
- Can we *balance access and profit*?
- How do we preserve *ethical, healing-centered care*?

> We’re seeing a collision between *sacred tradition* and *Silicon Valley ambition.*
