### "Flying Ointment" and Witchcraft
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
In the Middle Ages, folk healers made *psychoactive ointments* using herbs like:
- Belladonna
- Datura
- Mandrake

These ointments could induce sensations of *flying* and were absorbed through *mucous membranes*—including the *vaginal route* via a broomstick handle.

Yes, this is the *origin of the "witch flying on a broomstick" trope*.

### Colonial Suppression and the Inquisition

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*The First Intentional War on Drugs*
  
We’ve already had many wars on drugs throughout history—some accidental. But the first *intentional*, organized crackdown was the *Inquisition*, launched by the *Roman Catholic Church* in 1184 CE.

By the 1500s, the Inquisition had expanded to *Mexico*, where it encountered Aztec communities using:
- *Psilocybin mushrooms* (*Teonanácatl*, or “flesh of the gods”)
- *Peyote*
- Other sacred plant medicines

To the Catholic Church, these psychedelic practices posed a major threat:
- *Catholicism offered mediated access to the divine* through church rituals and hierarchy  
- Indigenous practices offered *direct communion with the divine*, unmediated by clergy

*The Eucharist vs. Teonanácatl*

In Catholicism, the Eucharist is symbolic—faith and belief are required to perceive the bread and wine as “the body and blood of Christ.”
But Aztec ceremonies with mushrooms were *experiential*. The divine wasn’t metaphor—it was something you *felt*, *saw*, and *became*.
This terrified the Church. People didn’t need them to access spirit.
