### Examples of Current Legal Models

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *Oregon Measure 109* (first regulated psilocybin services program in the U.S.)
- *Colorado Natural Medicine Program* (expanding to include more natural entheogens)
- Dozens of cities and counties have decriminalized psychedelic use

These models emphasize:
- *Access for healing*
- *Training for facilitators*
- *Safe containers* for altered states

### A New Narrative for Mental Health?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
This wave challenges the *dominant psychiatric paradigm*, which often views mental health through a purely biochemical lens.

Instead, psychedelics offer:
- A *bio-psycho-social-spiritual model*
- An emphasis on *healing through connection, insight, and integration*
- The potential for *transformational change*, not just symptom management

> "What if the future of mental health isn’t a better pill—but a better paradigm?”

### Caution: A Movement Vulnerable to Backlash
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
We must *move carefully and with integrity.* Because psychedelic work challenges entrenched systems and beliefs, there will be pushback.

We’ve seen this before:
- *War on Drugs*
- *Anti-psychedelic propaganda*
- *Media sensationalism*
- *Scapegoating and moral panic*

One bad outcome—especially if mishandled—could set the movement back years.

### The Role of Facilitators

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Each of you is becoming a *representative* of this field.

Whether you plan to facilitate or simply be in community:
- Practice *integrity*
- Be *trauma-informed*
- Walk your talk
- Help build the *public trust* we need to advance this movement
