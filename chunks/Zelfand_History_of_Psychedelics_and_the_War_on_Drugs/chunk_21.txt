| Alcohol               | High         | Very High         |
| Heroin                | Very High     | Moderate           |
| Crack Cocaine         | Very High     | High               |
| LSD                   | Low           | Very Low           |
| Psilocybin Mushrooms  | Lowest       | None              |

*Alcohol* was the most dangerous overall—*more harmful to others than to the user*.

*Mushrooms* were the *least harmful drug* surveyed, with *zero* documented societal harm.

### Quote from Terence McKenna

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
> “Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned you may jump out of a third-story window.  
They’re illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behavior and information processing.”
