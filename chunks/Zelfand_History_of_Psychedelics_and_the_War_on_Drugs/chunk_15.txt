### The Third Wave: Counterculture, Harvard, and Government Crackdown
*(1960s – 1970s)*

*The Harvard Psilocybin Project*

Let’s fast forward to the *1960s*, when psychedelic interest takes off in a new direction—led by *academics and rebels alike*.

Two central figures:
- *Dr. Timothy Leary* – a Harvard psychology professor
- *Dr. Richard Alpert* – his colleague (who would later become *Ram Dass*)

Together, they launched the *Harvard Psilocybin Project*. Initially, the project had the blessing of the department chair—with one big rule:
> *No giving drugs to undergrads.*

But things quickly went sideways:
- No control groups in the studies
- Researchers tripping alongside subjects
- Party-like atmosphere
- Blurred lines between researcher and participant

It started to look more like a *cult* than a research study.

*Allen Ginsberg and the Good Friday Experiment*
  
Poet *Allen Ginsberg* was a friend of Leary’s and took part in their experiments.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Meanwhile, *Walter Pahnke*, a *Harvard divinity student*, conducted a famous study known as the *Good Friday Experiment* (also called the *Marsh Chapel Experiment*) in *1962*.
Study design:
- 20 seminary students
- Half received *psilocybin*
- Half received a *placebo*

Nearly everyone who took psilocybin reported a *profound religious experience*. One participant said it was:
> “The most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced.”

25 years later, in *1991*, *Rick Doblin* (of MAPS) tracked down participants.  
*9 out of 10* said the experience profoundly shaped their lives.

*The Missing Details*
  
However, Pahnke’s original report *left out key information*:
- One participant had to be restrained and given *Thorazine*
- Others experienced *acute anxiety*

These omissions made the research seem more pristine than it was.
