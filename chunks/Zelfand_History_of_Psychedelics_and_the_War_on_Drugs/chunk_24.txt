### Decriminalization and Legalization Efforts

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
As research progressed, public opinion shifted. Cities and states began to *decriminalize* and even *legalize* psilocybin.

Examples:
- *Denver, CO* – First U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin (2019)
- *Oregon* – First state to legalize psilocybin services (Measure 109, 2020)
- *Colorado* – Passed statewide legalization in 2022

> *Public support and scientific validation* are converging like never before.

### The Rise of Mushroom Culture

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Mushrooms are hot right now—even in *fashion*.
- Dresses made from *mycelium*
- Mushroom-themed decor, art, tattoos
- Fungi as a sustainability symbol

> Mushrooms are becoming the new *avocado toast*—trendy, symbolic, and multi-functional.

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**

But as we’ll see in the *Fifth Wave*, this brings new complexities—like commercialization, tech startups, and debates over access and ethics.
