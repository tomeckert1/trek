### Indigenous Strategies for Preservation

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Despite severe repression, some indigenous cultures managed to *protect and preserve* their sacred practices.

*The Huichol (Wixárika)*
- Nomadic desert-dwelling people
- Guardians of *peyote*
- Survived colonization partly because they didn’t claim or defend private land—making it difficult for colonizers to control them
- Maintained peyote pilgrimage traditions and continue to steward the medicine today

> InnerTrek has a relationship with a *Wixárika Marakame (healer)* named Venado (“deer”), who facilitates peyote ceremonies with cultural and ecological reciprocity.

*The Mazatec of Oaxaca*
- Stewards of *mushroom medicine*
- Based in *Huautla de Jiménez*, Oaxaca
- Used a clever strategy: they *cloaked their practices in Catholic imagery*
  - Jesus = sacred mushroom
  - Virgin Mary = representation of Mother Earth

In *Mazatec mushroom ceremonies* (*veladas*), you’ll often hear a blend of:
- *Indigenous songs and chants*
- *Spanish-language Catholic prayers* (e.g., repeated *Ave Marias*)

This cultural blending allowed the Mazatec to keep their medicine traditions alive under the radar of colonial powers.
