### Enter: LSD-25 and Albert Hofmann

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:** 
Let’s shift to *Albert Hofmann*, a Swiss chemist working for *Sandoz Laboratories* in Basel.
- Goal: Develop a *cardiovascular drug* using alkaloids from *ergot*, a fungus that grows on rye and causes vasoconstriction
- In *1938*, Hofmann synthesized the 25th derivative of ergot—*LSD-25* (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)

Preliminary animal tests weren’t promising. The animals just got “agitated,” so he *put it on the shelf for 5 years*.

But in *1943*, Hofmann suddenly felt drawn back to LSD-25. He re-synthesized it, and—by accident—*absorbed some through his skin* (or possibly inhaled it—we’re still not sure).

### The First LSD Trip: Bicycle Day
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Here’s Hofmann in his own words:
> “In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed, I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense kaleidoscopic play of colors.”

This catches his interest, so a few days later, he *intentionally takes a dose*:  
*250 micrograms* — which he assumes is “too low to do anything.”

But LSD is one of the most potent psychoactive substances ever discovered. 250 mcg is a *huge* dose.
- He becomes overwhelmed
- Leaves work and *rides his bicycle home*, assisted by his lab assistant
- Date: *April 19, 1943* — now celebrated as *Bicycle Day*

Later, he describes the experience:
> “Familiar objects and pieces of furniture seemed grotesque, threatening... Everything glistened and sparkled in a fresh light. The world was as if newly created.”

### The Aftermath
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**

The doctor examines him and finds:
- Dilated pupils
- Otherwise, nothing wrong

Hofmann realizes: This is *powerful*, and we don’t yet understand it.
