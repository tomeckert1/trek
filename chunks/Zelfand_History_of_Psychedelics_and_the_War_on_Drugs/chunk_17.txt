### Nixon’s Controlled Substances Act (1970)

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
In response to the counterculture, Nixon passed the *Controlled Substances Act* in *1970*, creating:

- The *Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)*
- The *drug scheduling system* (Schedule I to V)

### What Is a Schedule I Drug?

- *No accepted medical use*
- *High potential for abuse*
- Examples: *Heroin, LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA, Cannabis, Peyote*

> Ironically, *cocaine and methamphetamine* were placed in *Schedule II*, considered less risky than psilocybin.

### What Was the Drug War *Really* About?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Nixon’s assistant *John Ehrlichman* later admitted:
> “We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be anti-war or Black...  
> But by associating hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily...  
> We could disrupt those communities.”

The War on Drugs was not about public safety—it was about *suppressing dissent*.
