### Closing Reflections

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
The psychedelic movement is no longer underground—it’s global.

We now face:
- *Regulatory battles*
- *Training standards*
- *Public perception*
- *Economic pressures*

And yet, we also face a *tremendous opportunity*: to reshape mental health, heal communities, and reconnect people with themselves and the sacred.

### Resources
