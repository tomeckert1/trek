### The First Wave: Ancient and Indigenous Psychedelic Use

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*The "Stoned Ape" Theory*
  
Let’s rewind all the way to before 5000 BCE. According to the *Stoned Ape Theory*, proposed by Terence McKenna in *Food of the Gods*, psychedelic mushrooms may have played a significant role in the evolution of primates into humans.

The theory suggests that psilocybin mushrooms may have:
- Contributed to the doubling of the human brain
- Influenced the development of language through synesthesia
- Catalyzed early spirituality and cognitive expansion

It’s just a theory—but it’s a juicy one.

*Archaeological Evidence of Mushroom Use*
  
Fast-forward to around 5000 BCE and beyond—we have archaeological evidence of mushroom use around the world:

- *Southeastern Algeria*: Cave paintings of what appears to be a mushroom shaman  
- *3700 BCE, Rio Grande*: Effigy sculptures
- *Rigveda (India)*: Mentions of a psychoactive drink called *soma*
- *1500 BCE, Guatemala*: Mushroom stones, suggesting mushrooms held cultural and possibly religious significance
- *Mexico*: Mushroom stones and iconography, pointing to ceremonial use
- *Siberian caves*: Evidence of *Amanita muscaria* mushroom use
