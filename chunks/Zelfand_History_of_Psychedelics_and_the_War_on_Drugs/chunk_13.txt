### Cultural Views of Mushrooms: Mycophobia vs. Mycophilia
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s talk mushroom culture:
- Some societies are *mycophobic* — afraid of mushrooms. (Example: the U.S., traditionally.)
- Others are *mycophilic* — mushroom lovers! (Example: my family in Ukraine and Russia.)

This contrast plays into how different cultures have either *embraced or shunned* sacred mushroom use.

### R. Gordon Wasson and Valentina Pavlovna: Bridging Cultures
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
In the 1950s, this cultural fusion came to life through a couple:
- *R. Gordon Wasson* (an American banker, mycophobic)
- *Valentina Pavlovna Wasson* (a Russian doctor, mycophilic)

In *1952*, a friend sent them a copy of Schultes’ 1938 paper (the one no one paid attention to at the time). The Wassons were hooked.

They traveled to *Huautla de Jiménez, Mexico*, where they met *María Sabina*, a *Mazatec curandera* who worked with psilocybin mushrooms in ceremonial healing.
