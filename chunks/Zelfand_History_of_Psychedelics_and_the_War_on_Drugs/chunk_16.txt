### Leary and Alpert Go Rogue

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Leary and Alpert ignored Harvard’s warnings and gave drugs to undergrads.

*Andrew Weil* (yes, the integrative medicine pioneer) *reported them.*

In *1963*, both were fired from Harvard.

Leary’s catchphrase became a cultural marker:

> “Turn on, tune in, drop out.”

### Ken Kesey and the Acid Tests*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
In *1960*, author *Ken Kesey* volunteered for a government study—part of *MK-Ultra*, the CIA’s secret mind control program.

They gave him *LSD*, and it blew his mind.

Kesey later:
- Wrote *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*
- Started the *Merry Pranksters*
- Traveled the U.S. in the *“Further” bus*
- Hosted massive *“Acid Test” parties* featuring *The Grateful Dead*

### The Public Psychedelic Boom*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
- *1967*: The *Summer of Love* (San Francisco, 100,000 people)
- *1969*: *Woodstock* Festival (500,000+ attendees, widespread LSD use)
- *1969*: The largest anti-war demonstration in U.S. history (also 500,000 people)

President *Richard Nixon* declared Leary:
> “The most dangerous man in America.”

Leary was arrested in *1966*, escaped jail in *1970*, and fled to *Switzerland*, *Beirut*, and *Kabul* before being recaptured.

Meanwhile, *Alpert* became *Ram Dass*, focusing on spiritual teachings instead of rebellion.
