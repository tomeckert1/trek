### The Fourth Wave: The Psychedelic Renaissance
*(1990s – 2010s)*

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*Rebirth of Scientific Interest*
  
After decades of prohibition, research into psychedelics *slowly resumed* in the 1990s.

In *1997*, *Dr. Franz Vollenweider* at the *University of Zurich* conducted the first modern clinical trial with psilocybin.

This helped open the door for a wave of *peer-reviewed, controlled studies* on psychedelics.

*Understanding the FDA Approval Process*

To understand how psychedelics move from illegal to legal medicine, here’s a quick primer on *FDA drug approval phases*:
1. *Phase I* – Is it safe? (Small number of healthy volunteers)
2. *Phase II* – Does it work? (Preliminary efficacy on a small scale)
3. *Phase III* – Does it really work? (Larger trials, typically 300+ participants)
4. *Phase IV* – Post-marketing surveillance (After the drug is released)

> Fun Fact: You, the consumer, are often the Phase IV guinea pig.

### Who Funds Psychedelic Research?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Traditionally, clinical research is funded by:
- *Pharmaceutical companies* (profit-driven, patent-focused)
- *Government agencies* (like the NIH, which won’t touch Schedule I drugs)

So who funds psychedelic studies?

*Private philanthropists and nonprofits* stepped in, including:
- *Tim Ferriss*
- *David Bronner*
- *Shane Staley* (Tom’s of Maine)
- *The Sheri Eckert Foundation* (InnerTrek-related, Oregon-based)

> These funders often have *personal healing experiences* that motivate them to give back and support the movement.
