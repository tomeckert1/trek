### Amanita Muscaria: Not Psilocybin

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s talk about a common misconception. The red mushroom with white dots emoji —that’s *Amanita muscaria*, not a psilocybin mushroom. It contains:
- *Ibotenic acid*
- *Muscimol*

These compounds are psychoactive but also *neurotoxic* if not properly prepared.

*Traditional Use in Siberia*

Indigenous peoples of Siberia found a clever workaround:  
- *Reindeer* would eat the Amanita muscaria  
- *Shamans* would then *consume the reindeer's urine*, which had filtered out the toxic compounds but retained the psychoactive effects

This is where the *myth of flying reindeer* originates. Even Santa Claus himself is thought to be a cultural depiction of the red-and-white mushroom.

### A Note on "Shamanism"

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**  
The term "shaman" gets used and misused a lot. The word actually comes from the *Tungus tribe in Siberia*, from the verb meaning *"to know."*

While the word is often applied cross-culturally today, it is not Spanish in origin—although it has been adapted into Spanish as *chamán*.
