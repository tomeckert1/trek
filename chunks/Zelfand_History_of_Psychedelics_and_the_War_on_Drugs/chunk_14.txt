### María Sabina Shares the Medicine

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
In *1955*, María Sabina became the *first Mexican curandera to share psilocybin mushrooms with a Westerner*.

Wasson’s experience was published in *Life Magazine* in *1957*, in an article titled *“Seeking the Magic Mushroom.”*

This:
- Coined the phrase *“magic mushrooms”*
- Catapulted psilocybin into Western awareness
- Sparked massive outsider interest in indigenous ceremonies

### Consequences for María Sabina and Her People
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Sadly, this visibility had *serious consequences* for María Sabina and her community:

> “I realized the young people with long hair didn’t need me to eat the little things.”  
> – María Sabina

- Outsiders swarmed Huautla de Jiménez
- Local customs were disrespected
- María Sabina was *blamed* for sharing the medicine
- Her house was burned down
- She was *raided regularly by the police*
- She died in *1985*, poor and ostracized

Even Wasson later admitted:
> “A practice carried on in secret for three centuries or more has now been aerated. And aeration spells the end.”

### Rediscovery and Reverence
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Today, María Sabina is *revered* in Huautla:
- Her name is everywhere—*murals, taxi companies, statues*
- She is recognized as a *local legend*
- Her story is a reminder of the *ethics of cultural sharing and preservation*

> Psilocybin mushrooms are found on every continent except Antarctica, in over *200+ species*.  
> No one owns psilocybin—it is part of the earth’s shared pharmacy.
