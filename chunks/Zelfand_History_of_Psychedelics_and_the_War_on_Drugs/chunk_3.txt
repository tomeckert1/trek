### Overview: A Crash Course in Psychedelic History

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Today we're going to do a crash course in psychedelic history, covering a time span from before 5000 BCE to the present. There’ll be jokes, and hopefully time for Q&A.

Let’s begin with the *Five Waves* of psychedelic history.

### The Five Waves of Psychedelic History

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
You might’ve heard people talk about the "waves" of psychedelic history. There’s even a company called Third Wave. So, what are these waves?

*First Wave: Indigenous and Ancient Use*
From the beginning of time (possibly earlier than 5000 BCE) to the 1800s. This wave centers around the use of psychedelics by indigenous peoples and ancient societies for healing, divination, and spiritual connection. Healing and spirituality were deeply intertwined.

*Second Wave: Scientific Discovery and Curiosity*
Late 1800s to 1950s. This wave includes early scientific inquiry into psychedelic compounds—what they are and how they might help with mental health.

*Third Wave: Counterculture and Backlash*
The 1960s hippie era. Includes both government research and public enthusiasm. Timothy Leary, tie-dye, the Grateful Dead, and Nixon’s War on Drugs all come into play here.

*Fourth Wave: The Psychedelic Renaissance*
1990s to 2010s. A resurgence in scientific research with an emphasis on therapeutic application for psychiatric and psychological conditions.

*Fifth Wave: Mainstreaming and Commercialization*
Present day. This wave includes legalization efforts, commercialization, biotech startups, and increased media attention. Psychedelics are becoming more mainstream.
