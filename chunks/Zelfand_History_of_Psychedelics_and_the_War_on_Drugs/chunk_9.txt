### Reflection & Q&A

**Student (Tessa):**
How do we know all this? What’s theory and what’s fact?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Great question. From the Middle Ages forward, much of the history is *well-documented*—Inquisition records, medical reports, archaeological findings.

But when it comes to ancient history—before written language or widespread record-keeping—historians rely on:
- *Archaeological evidence*
- *Comparative mythology*
- *Speculative theory*, often detailed in books like *The Psychedelic Gospels*, *The Immortality Key*, and *The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross*

So:  
- *Post-1500s = more concrete*  
- *Ancient use = well-supported theories*

### Attending Mazatec Ceremonies Today

**Student (Mallory):**
Are Mazatec ceremonies open to visitors? Can we attend?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Yes, though it depends. Many indigenous communities now offer *limited tourist-facing experiences*.

If you’re respectful and approach with humility:
- You *can* attend a traditional *velada*
- But don’t expect trauma-informed care or western-style protocols
- They do things their way

When I went, nobody asked my name, medical history, or even told me how much I was taking. It’s a *deep trust in the process*—very different from Western facilitation models.

### A Broader Global Context?

**Student (Miriam):**
Do we know if psychedelics were used in Asia or Australia?

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
That’s a great question—and one I want to research more deeply.

There are *some indicators* of psychedelic plant use in other regions (e.g., soma in the Rigveda from India), but much less documentation compared to Mesoamerica and the Mediterranean.

Thanks for inspiring me to look further into that!
