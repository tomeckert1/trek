### LSD Research Expands: Sandoz Crowd-Sources the Science
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
After World War II ended in *1945*, Sandoz Laboratories knew they had something incredible with *LSD-25*—but they had *no idea* what to use it for.

So they did something radical:
> They *crowdsourced* the research.

They told psychiatrists, therapists, and researchers around the world:
> “We’ll give you as much LSD as you want—just tell us what happens.”

They wanted to know:
- What is it good for?
- What does it do to the mind?
- Can it treat anything?

This widespread distribution led to many experiments and revelations—including the eventual *discovery of serotonin receptors*, thanks to how LSD works at *microgram doses*, indicating highly sensitive brain mechanisms.

### Ololiuqui (Morning Glory Seeds): Another Sacred Psychedelic
  
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Meanwhile, Schultes continued to send plant samples to Hofmann. One of them was *Ololiuqui*, the seeds of the morning glory flower.
- Used ceremonially in Mexico
- Hofmann analyzed the seeds and discovered they contain a *natural analog of LSD*

This was mind-blowing:  
These sacred seeds had been used *for generations* by indigenous people in Central Mexico, and only now were their active compounds being understood by Western science.

> It’s one of those beautiful synchronicities—right around the same time Hofmann was discovering LSD, Schultes was uncovering its natural cousins.
