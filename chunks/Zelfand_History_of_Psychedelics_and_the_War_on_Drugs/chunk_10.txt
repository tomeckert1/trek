### The Second Wave: Scientific Discovery (Late 1800s–1950s)

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
*From Indigenous Use to Laboratory Curiosity*
 
The *Second Wave* of psychedelic history spans the *late 1800s to the 1950s*. This is when science began to take a serious look at these compounds and ask:
- What are they?
- Can they be used in medicine?
- What do they teach us about the brain?

It was an era of both *scientific curiosity* and *cultural fascination*.

### Richard Evans Schultes: The Father of Ethnobotany
 
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Let’s talk about *Richard Evans Schultes*, a Harvard-educated ethnobotanist who had a massive influence on modern psychedelic science.
- Known as the *“Father of Ethnobotany”*
- Harvard professor for over 70 years
- Authored *10 books* and nearly *500 scientific papers*
- Collected *30,000+ plants* (250,000 specimens total!)
- Described over *2,000 medicinal plants* previously unknown to science
- Even has over *120 species*, including a species of cockroach, named after him

But he wasn’t just sitting in an ivory tower—he was in the field:
- Survived *malaria 21 times*
- Contracted *beriberi*
- Traveled extensively, including deep into Mexico

### 1938: Mushroom Use in Mexico Rediscovered

**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
In *July 1938*, Schultes read evidence in the Harvard library that *hallucinogenic mushrooms* were still being used in Mexico for spiritual purposes. The source? A man named *Reko*, who was still alive at the time.

So Schultes gets on a *Greyhound bus from Cambridge* and heads to *Oaxaca, Mexico*—no cell phone, no Facebook, just determination. He tracks down Reko (who turned out to be a *Nazi sympathizer*), and together, they put aside their differences to pursue the truth about mushrooms.

That same year, Schultes publishes a scientific paper on *Teonanácatl* (*Psilocybe mexicana*). But… it’s *1938*, and *World War II* is brewing. No one notices or cares.

He continues his work and writes his doctoral thesis in *1941* on:
- *Teonanácatl* (psilocybin mushrooms)
- *Ololiuqui* (morning glory seeds)

### Schultes’ Broader Contributions
 
**Dr. Erica Zelfand:**
Schultes didn’t stop with mushrooms. He also:
- Brought *ayahuasca* and *curare* to the West
- Advocated for *Native American rights* to their sacred plant practices
- Testified in defense of college students charged with marijuana possession in the '70s
- Showed that “primitive people” had *knowledge and wisdom* that surpassed Western assumptions

> Recommended Reading: *One River* by Wade Davis (a student of Schultes) is a great biography.
