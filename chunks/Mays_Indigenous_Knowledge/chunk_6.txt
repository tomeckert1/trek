### Relational Ontology and the Inner Healer

**Joseph Mays:**
Reciprocity — often treated as a vague ideal — only becomes meaningful within a system of relationship between beings who recognize each other as subjects with agency.

So how do we view others — not just other humans, but trees, forests, fungi, rivers, even synthetic compounds? How do we see them? And how do they see us?

There’s a story from the Runa people in the Amazon, described by anthropologist Eduardo Kohn in *How Forests Think*. He was on a hunting trip with the Runa. They told him to sleep face-up at night. Why? Because if a jaguar approaches and sees your face, it will recognize you as a subject — a being capable of looking back. And then it will leave you alone.

For the Runa, how other beings see us is important. The fact that other beings perceive us challenges the nature/culture division we've been conditioned into by the dominant worldview. That story says humans alone have agency and subjectivity — but it’s not true.

If we accept that seeing, thinking, and knowing are not exclusive to humans — or even to animals — then the colonial story of separation begins to collapse.

Ecology is moving in this direction. But it still emerges from a tradition of reductionism and fragmentation.

**Joseph Mays:**
Ecology comes from the Greek word *oikos*, meaning “home.” It’s the study of relationships among organisms. If we want to address ecological crisis, we have to understand relationships. The same applies to mental health crises and social breakdown.

Before we can truly embrace healing systems that treat medicines as intelligent beings, or healing as a communal experience, we have to understand the relationships that make up our world — and the stories we tell about those relationships.
  
What story do we tell about ourselves? What story do we unconsciously believe? These stories give us our orientation — our identity, our relationships.

The dominant story says we are separate individuals, programmed by our genes to pursue reproductive fitness. That we are born into a deterministic world filled with lifeless nature, devoid of agency.

### Ontology, Ecology, and the Stories We Inhabit

**Joseph Mays:**
That’s not sustainable. And it’s not even scientific. It’s a cultural perspective — a colonial inheritance.

Brazilian anthropologist Mauro Almeida calls this the "monetary ontology." It’s the worldview that dominates our institutions — the one that weaponizes science, reaps the benefits of Indigenous ethnopharmacology, and simultaneously dismisses Indigenous ontologies as unscientific.

This contradiction results in the degradation of forests and communities by the very forces that profit from them.

If we could adopt a relational ontology — one that views forests as living, thinking networks — then we could start to recognize the agency of other beings, including organic compounds.

We might then begin to respect local autonomy and ensure the protection of biocultural diversity, ecological knowledge, and cultural sovereignty.

When we integrate this understanding into our work, we can begin approaching something that resembles true reciprocity — with our partners, our patients, and the world around us.

**Joseph Mays:**
Let me introduce you to Don Ricardo.

Don Ricardo was a Yánesha elder from the community of Saco Pen in central Peru. He was one of my closest friends and collaborators during my graduate fieldwork.

The first time I interviewed him, he invited me to his “office,” which was a shaded area next to his chili pepper field and herb garden. We sat on wooden stools he built himself. He joked that he would charge me a hundred soles an hour for interviews.

At one point, during a deep conversation, a chorus of birds began singing overhead. Ricardo lit up, paused, and said, “Listen to the little parrots. It’s not always like this. It means this is a good moment. They only sing that way sometimes.”

In his seventies, Ricardo remembered when that birdsong was much more common.

He had lived through the deforestation of the Chorobamba River Valley, religious persecution by Franciscan missionaries, displacement by settlers, and ongoing violence and discrimination. He had been the *cornesha* (leader) of his community and once traveled to the United States for an Indigenous summit.

**Joseph Mays:**
Despite all that, he welcomed me with open arms. Whether he was harvesting coffee, tending his garden, or watching boxing on TV, he was always listening — always in communication with the forest, which speaks to us whether we hear it or not.
  
I remember my first visit to the rainforest at the meeting point between the Andes Mountains and the Amazon Basin. As I moved through that landscape, the soundscape changed: revving engines and barking dogs gave way to singing birds, chirping insects, and rustling canopy.

The tree-covered mountainsides were filled with large-leafed species. As I traveled deeper, the highland conifers gave way to lowland species — creating a liminal space between biomes.

In Saco Pen, Peru — where this took place — there are no living shamans. The community does not currently use psychedelic plants. But they do sing a song about ayahuasca.

Ayahuasca is a Quechua term for the *Banisteriopsis caapi* vine, which is often combined with *Psychotria viridis* — *chacruna*, also a Quechua word. Together, they form the ayahuasca brew.

The Yánesha language, spoken by Don Ricardo, is a fusion of Quechua from the Andes and Arawakan languages from the lowlands — the linguistic family of words like “hammock” and “tobacco,” and of the languages spoken across the Caribbean before Columbus’s invasion.

Traditional ecological knowledge is encoded in language. That’s why language preservation is so crucial. Every Indigenous language encodes sophisticated environmental knowledge.
