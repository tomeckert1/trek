### Systems Thinking and Plant Intelligence

**Joseph Mays:**
Fifteen years ago, plant intelligence was a taboo topic in biology. I remember giving a high school presentation on plant neurobiology — nobody wanted to hear it. Zoologists and neurologists dismissed it completely. Now it’s showing up in mainstream media and documentaries.

The psychedelic idea of “thinking forests” reflects this growing understanding — not just in ecosystems, but also in social systems.

Relational ontologies — ones that prioritize relationship over reductionism — help us see that greater community autonomy often results in greater biodiversity, carbon storage, and ecological health.

This includes Indigenous territories and community-owned lands. The evidence shows that when communities have decision-making power, the land flourishes.

That points toward grassroots models of organization — distributed, rhizomatic, mycelial — rather than top-down, hierarchical structures.

This is true not just for conservation, but also for healthcare, advocacy, activism, and funding models. All of these can be redesigned to reflect the interconnectivity we experience in nature — and in psychedelic states.

The healing power of a plant or compound is inseparable from the relationships in which it exists. Its potency comes from its relational context — with other beings, with land, with culture.

This relational understanding can guide us in building new models of care — new healthcare systems, new therapeutic practices, and new approaches to reciprocity.

**Joseph Mays:**
I’ll share a story from the Runa, guided by their *ayahuasqueros*. They have a category of stories called “jaguar-catching myths,” which teach lessons about perception and collaboration.

One of them goes like this:

A man is patching a leaky roof. He asks his son-in-law to help by poking a stick through the holes from the inside, so he can see where to patch from the outside. The man on the roof can’t see the leaks directly, but when the stick pokes through, he knows where to fix the thatch.

To me, that stick is like the psychedelic insight — it helps us align inner and outer perspectives. It connects our symbolic, human framework with the more-than-human world that is always communicating, always alive.

To embrace reciprocity, we must be willing to go beyond the ontologies we’re most familiar with. Only then can we begin to ask the deeper questions: How do we change our culture? How do we reorient our systems? How do we build new pathways — in healthcare, in ecology, in collective healing?
