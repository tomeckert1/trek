### Human-Shaped Landscapes and Watersheds

**Joseph Mays:**
In 2014, I traveled from the rainforests of Appalachia to the rainforest of Ecuador. I began working at an ecological reserve and first encountered medicines that still guide me today in this work.

As I mentioned, ERI — the Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative of the Americas — is a community-led program of Chacruna. It consists of Indigenous organizations engaged in food and water security, environmental health, land rights, and cultural sovereignty.

What connects all of these projects is that they are self-determined by local people. They are designed and implemented by Indigenous communities to meet their own needs and priorities — not imposed from the outside.

### The ERI Model: Principles and Practice

**Joseph Mays:**
Another unique element is that funding is fully controlled by the communities. It is unconditional. The authority remains solely in their hands.

And there's another thread connecting the crises these communities face: the dominant cultural and economic system that alienates and commodifies every part of our inner and outer worlds.

ERI is informed by a deep investigation of that system — of cultural conditioning, cosmological concepts, and unconscious beliefs about reality that underlie supposedly secular or objective approaches to science and medicine.

This is where ontology comes in. Ontology is our experience of reality — our foundational sense of what is real.

Our ontological perspective shapes our attitudes, behaviors, and the efficacy of our approaches to science, healing, medicine — and all forms of care.

**Joseph Mays:**
I’ve been especially interested in what we can learn from relational ontologies. This is a worldview in which beings — human and non-human — exist in a system of relationship, where reciprocity is the main mode of relating.

This perspective allows for concepts like “inner healing intelligence.” You may have heard this in the MAPS MDMA training. It sounds unscientific at first, but the concept has empirical traction. It has measurable impact on treatment outcomes.

The idea of an inner healer fits easily in a relational ontology, but it doesn’t align well with the biomedical model dominant in the global north. This conflict also appears in conservation, ecological science, and other domains.
