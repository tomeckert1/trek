### Cultural Hybridity and Living Traditions

**Joseph Mays:**
Reducing people and ecosystems to simplified narratives is a form of what Karl Marx called the "metabolic rift" — a social and ecological alienation from the sources of life: the resources we survive on, the ecosystems that produce them, and the communities whose sacrifices sustain us.

Recognizing the distributed intelligence of forests — and of communities — helps us see that this is not just an ecological principle. It’s a social, political, and economic one.

It’s about building systems — in healthcare, conservation, education, and philanthropy — that reflect the relational, regenerative nature of the ecosystems we’re embedded in.
  
We’re beginning to understand the intelligence of nature — how plants and fungi sense and respond to their environment, to gravity, light, touch, and sound. They store memory, integrate information, and adapt. These are all activities that, in animals, we call “thinking.”
