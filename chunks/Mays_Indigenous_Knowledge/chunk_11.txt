### The Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative (ERI)
  
**Joseph Mays:**
I want to tell you a bit more about the work I do with Chacruna and the Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative of the Americas, or ERI. I’ll also share some interviews we conducted with Indigenous partners in the Mazatec region of Mexico.

But first, a quick pause — if there are any burning questions, feel free to interrupt me at any time. After this final section, we’ll have more time for discussion.

Let me continue with the overview.

We launched ERI in April 2021 after a year of development. It’s a community-directed biocultural conservation program. It connects people directly with grassroots Indigenous organizations at the local level, with the aim of giving back to the cultural regions that support Indigenous plant use and knowledge.

ERI created a pooled fund that supports local and Indigenous initiatives with a “no strings attached” philosophy. That means no funder agenda, no imposed conditions.

Any relationship between a global north organization and a local Indigenous community will carry an inherent power imbalance. So we constantly ask: Who is really benefiting? Who is compensated — and how — in both the short and long term?

**Joseph Mays:**
As ERI’s Program Director, my job is to ensure that power and authority remain with the communities. I do not control how resources are distributed, how money is used, or how projects are conducted. All of that power lies within the Indigenous and local organizations themselves.

ERI was deliberately built this way — to reflect a relational and ecological worldview. Rather than a linear, top-down model, we follow a rhizomatic, mycelial structure. It’s guided by horizontal networks of trust and mutual respect.

We currently support 20 different organizations across 7 countries, representing 38 Indigenous groups and communities.

The projects include:

- Community mapping and tree planting  
- Struggles for land tenure by the Cofán in Ecuador  
- Reforestation of Kaingang territory with Paraná pine — a traditional species used to mark sacred borders  
- Matsigenka-led documentation of traditional stories  
- Shipibo-Konibo medicinal plant gardens and seed-sharing networks  
- Hikuri (peyote) conservation initiatives in Mexico  
- Quechua-led health and environmental revitalization efforts in Peru and Ecuador

In every case, funding decisions are made by the communities themselves. There’s no approval process for reallocating funds in a crisis. For example, one of our partners — Chief Ninawa Huni Kui — responded to a water and food shortage during a major protest in Brasília by using ERI funds to deliver emergency supplies. No bureaucracy. Just direct action based on local need.

**Joseph Mays:**
Because ERI is self-managed by communities, it can adapt quickly. Funds are used for salaries, transportation, health care, vital supplies — whatever is most urgent at that moment. But always in support of long-term, self-determined goals.
  
This past summer, I spent several months in Mexico doing fieldwork with our partners in the Sierra Mazateca and the Wirikuta Desert in northern Mexico.

We conducted collaborative interviews and created shared spaces for dialogue. We discussed the impacts of the so-called psychedelic renaissance on Indigenous communities, explored perspectives on reciprocity — or its absence — and looked at conservation strategies.

We're continuing to co-produce video materials with our Indigenous partners based on their needs and requests.

Let me share a few examples.

This is Doña Sofía, a traditional healer in Oaxaca. She doesn’t speak Spanish — her grandson translated for us during our visit.

We also worked on conservation efforts, including peyote monitoring in Wirikuta. When peyote poachers rip ancient mats from the ground, they often leave the smaller “babies” behind to dry out and die. Our teams identify these sites and replant the survivors to help the ecosystem recover.

One of our partner groups, Secopí, created a plant nursery in Mexico. They use community assemblies to vote on which species to cultivate. Based on these decisions, they map where to plant and which regions to reforest — all grounded in traditional knowledge.

In another part of the Mazatec region, we worked with a group called Sripakma. The leaders — Roberto, Eloy, and Laura — are doing incredible work.

- Roberto is a poet, writer, and church leader. He was once a Catholic priest and now leads a new religious movement that blends pre-Columbian practices with Christian symbols.  
- Eloy is a Mazatec ethnolinguist working to preserve and document dialect diversity across the Sierra.  
- Laura is the treasurer of Sripakma and a community advocate.

**Joseph Mays:**
With ERI’s support, they launched a bilingual radio program broadcasting in Mazatec and Spanish.

There’s a lot of mythology around the Mazatec and María Sabina. Her legacy is often romanticized — stripped of Catholic elements and recast as a pre-Columbian shamanic figure.

But María Sabina was a devout Catholic. She sang about Jesus Christ and saw the mushrooms as connected to saints like Saint Peter and Saint Paul.

When we erase those elements to create a more “pure” or “authentic” Indigenous image, we’re actually reenacting colonial dynamics — denying the community’s real, lived history.

What’s truly authentic is what people are practicing now — in all its diversity and hybridity.

Every town in the Sierra has different practices. Some communities are even reclaiming more traditional prayer forms — still calling the mushrooms “the blood of Christ,” but using only Mazatec prayers instead of Catholic ones.

Authenticity doesn’t mean returning to a frozen past. It means respecting people’s lived traditions, in context — as they are, not as we wish them to be.
