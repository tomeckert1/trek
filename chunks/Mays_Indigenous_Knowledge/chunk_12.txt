### Questions & Reflections

**Richard (participant):**
Thank you so much for your presentation. I recently visited Oaxaca and tried to learn about pre-Columbian mushroom ceremonies. I found that many current practices are mixed with Catholicism. Is there a way to access more "authentic" pre-Columbian ceremonies — to better honor the plant communities and traditions?

**Joseph Mays:**
That’s a really important question, Richard.

The truth is, you won’t find a pre-Columbian tradition in Oaxaca that’s untouched by Catholicism. The mixture you saw is organic — not imposed. Trying to remove the Catholic elements would actually erase part of the people’s real history.

This comes up a lot with María Sabina. Many people like to imagine her as a timeless medicine woman from antiquity — but they leave out her Catholicism. She sang about Jesus. She associated the mushrooms with saints.

To focus only on the “ancient” elements is to reenact the colonial gaze — the idea that Indigenous practices are only valuable if they’re untouched by history. But real, authentic practices are living traditions. They reflect the experiences of the people.

In the Sierra Mazateca, every town, every valley has its own style. Some groups are intentionally removing Catholic elements — they only pray in Mazatec. But even those communities still refer to the mushrooms as “the blood of Christ.”

So, instead of chasing a pure or ancient version, the best thing we can do is engage with people as they are. That is the most respectful and authentic way forward.

**Sarah (participant):**
What are your thoughts about biomedical research? Is there a way to conduct it ethically and with reciprocity?

**Joseph Mays:**
That's a really thoughtful question, Sarah.

You know, I’ve heard people say there’s “no ethical consumption under capitalism.” And maybe there’s truth in that — but it also doesn’t let us off the hook.

Each of us has a responsibility to try to act ethically within the systems we’re part of. That includes biomedical researchers. If you’re using resources and labor, you’re in relationship with the natural world and with people.

Can you ensure that compensation is fair and equitable at every level? Can you approach those relationships with humility and respect?

Reciprocity, in its true sense, means righting imbalance. It requires mutual recognition — two subjects, meeting with agency. That’s not the starting point between most Indigenous communities and global north institutions. The power differential is too great.

**Joseph Mays:**
So while ERI works to create the *conditions* for reciprocity, we’re not claiming that it already exists in perfect form.

The key is to be honest about power dynamics. At ERI, we are constantly reflecting on the imbalances that persist — even in nonprofit spaces. It’s hard work. But if you’re building research protocols, businesses, or care models, you can design them with reciprocity in mind.

That won’t fix the system, but it can begin to shift the culture. And that pressure — that awareness — can ripple outward and change expectations across the field.

### The Erie Model in Action

**Joseph Mays:** 
Let me tell you a little more about the development of ERI — the Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative of the Americas.

We launched the program in April 2021, after a year of collaborative development. It's a community-directed biocultural conservation initiative. Our goal is to connect people in the global north with grassroots Indigenous organizations that are protecting the cultural and ecological systems supporting sacred plant use.

What makes ERI unique?

- The funding is pooled and unconditional.  
- Communities decide how funds are used.  
- There are no external conditions, applications, or restrictions.  
- The power and authority reside entirely with local Indigenous groups.

I am not in control of how the money is spent. ERI is not a traditional nonprofit. It’s an effort to create a different kind of model — one that embodies the values we’ve been discussing.

**Joseph Mays:**
ERI reflects an ecological, relational worldview — like a mycelial network. Not hierarchical, not top-down. It is rooted in trust and local autonomy.

We currently support 20 organizations across 7 countries, representing 38 Indigenous communities.

Some examples:

- The Cofán in Ecuador: mapping their territory and fighting for land rights.  
- The Kaingang in Brazil: reforesting their ancestral land with Paraná pine — a sacred species deforested during World War II.  
- The Matsigenka in Peru: documenting oral histories and traditional stories.  
- The Shipibo-Konibo: building plant medicine gardens and seed-sharing networks.  
- The Wixarika in Mexico: conserving Hikuri (peyote) through ecological monitoring.

One story that sticks with me: Chief Ninawa Huni Kui, one of our partners, helped organize a major protest in Brasília against the genocide of Indigenous women.

There were more people than expected. A food and water shortage emerged. Ninawa’s association, funded by ERI, immediately used its funds to bus in emergency supplies. No waiting. No application process. No funder approval. Just action.

That kind of flexibility — that immediacy — is only possible when power rests with the community.
