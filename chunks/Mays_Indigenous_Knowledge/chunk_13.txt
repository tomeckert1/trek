### Rhizomatic Structure of ERI

**Joseph Mays:**
So far, we’ve raised $100,000 in the first eight months. It’s not enough — spread across 20 organizations, it’s thin — but it goes a long way. Every dollar supports long-term goals determined by the communities themselves.

ERI also co-produces educational materials. We work alongside Indigenous leaders to share knowledge on their terms, in their languages and mediums.

The theory of change behind ERI is this:

> Ground-up structures that emphasize local agency are the most meaningful way to support Indigenous autonomy — and the most effective way to protect biodiversity.

And I would add: they are also the most powerful way to support health — communal, ecological, and spiritual.
  
This is Doña Sofía, a traditional healer we interviewed in the Mazatec region. She doesn’t speak Spanish — her grandson translated for us.

We also worked with conservation monitors tracking peyote poaching. When poachers rip peyote mats from the earth, they leave smaller buttons to die. Our partners identify these areas and replant what they can.

**Joseph Mays:**
Another partner group, Secopí, built a community-led plant nursery. The community decides which species to grow, where to reforest, and how to implement long-term strategies through assembly-based decision-making.

In the Sierra Mazateca, we also collaborated with Sripakma — a collective led by Roberto, Eloy, and Laura.

- *Roberto*: a poet, former Catholic priest, and now a religious leader who integrates pre-Columbian practices into a new spiritual movement.  
- *Eloy*: an ethnolinguist focused on preserving regional dialects of Mazatec, which vary from valley to valley.  
- *Laura*: Sripakma’s treasurer and a key coordinator of their bilingual radio station.

With support from ERI, they launched a radio program that broadcasts in both Mazatec and Spanish. It’s one of the few spaces amplifying Indigenous language and worldview in this way.

### Mazatec Collaboration and Cultural Expression

**Joseph Mays:**
I want to return for a moment to the topic of appropriation and the mythologizing of figures like María Sabina.

There’s a poem often shared by well-meaning psychedelic organizations that’s attributed to María Sabina — it ends with the phrase “you are the medicine.” But María Sabina never said that.

It’s a romantic fabrication. The sentiment may sound empowering, but it reflects an individualist Western ontology — not a relational Indigenous one.

In the worldview I’ve been describing, healing is communal. The medicine arises from relationship — with land, with language, with ancestors, with other beings.

### Appropriation, Myth, and María Sabina

**Joseph Mays:**
When people say “you are the medicine,” what I think they really mean — if they’re coming from a relational perspective — is: *you are the intersection of your relationships*. Your body is part of the body of the Earth. Your healing is not separate from your community.

I remember my teacher in Mexico, Doña Carmen. Anytime I thanked her, she would say, “Thank God.” She would never take credit.

Before one ceremony, I was looking at a daunting pile of mushrooms and said, “I’m scared, but I trust you.” She replied, “Don’t trust me. Trust God.”

And for her, God is not a distant figure — it’s the living extension of all the relationships around her: the land, the plants, her family, her ancestors. That’s where the healing comes from.

She once said, “I don’t have time to be anxious or depressed — I’m too busy caring for my family and my land.” That wasn’t a dismissal of mental health, but an expression of embeddedness. Her life is in service, and that service is her medicine.

### Final Reflections and Closing Q&A

**Tal Sharabi:**
Thank you for that message, Joseph. You're speaking to a group of 105 future psilocybin guides here in Oregon. We’re talking about reciprocity and connection. Do you have a specific message — from your heart, your knowledge, your practice — for those stepping into this work?

**Joseph Mays:**
Thank you for the invitation. I’m not a therapist, but I do see a connection between the work I do and the work you all are preparing for. I believe my purpose is to serve. That’s the intention I carry in my heart.

But good intentions aren’t enough. My journey has been about aligning my actions and impacts with my intentions. If you’re still doing harm, good intentions don’t absolve you.

So my message is: I’m with you in this work. And the most amazing healers I’ve met are deeply humble. Like Doña Carmen — she never took credit. She always said, “Thank God.” For her, God is relational — woven into land, people, medicine.

If you want to be a healer or facilitator, recognize that your “self” is bigger than just your body or your narrative. Your body is part of the Earth. Healing is not just individual — it’s communal, ecological, spiritual.

We’re in a context — the medical model, the legal framework — but within that, we can find ways to bridge into something more relational.

**Gina Gratza (moderator):**
Thank you, Joseph. That really speaks to the theme of this evening. One of the top questions in our Slido is: “From where we stand now, culturally and geographically, how do we build relationships of reciprocity and avoid appropriation? What can we do?”

**Joseph Mays:**
That’s a big one.

I don’t have the authority to draw the line between appreciation and appropriation. I turn to my Indigenous colleagues for that.

But here’s what I do know: I focus on supporting Indigenous autonomy. That means listening to communities, supporting their priorities — food, water, land, language.

There is no sacred medicine without material security. If a community has its needs met, they can decide how they want to relate to outside practitioners or researchers.

Those relationships take time. There’s no instant access. No checklist. It requires trust, humility, and long-term engagement.

If those elements are in place, appropriation becomes far less likely. Most appropriation happens when people skip the hard parts — the relationship, the history, the power analysis.

**Gina Gratza:**
That reminds me that true relationship is not extractive. It evolves with care and attunement. 

**Joseph Mays:**
Exactly. And I’d add: educate yourself. Learn the history — not just of the plants, but of the people. Learn what Indigenous communities have survived, what they’re still fighting for. Read the voices of Indigenous activists, scholars, and knowledge holders.

When you show that you’ve done your homework, people are more likely to engage with you — to trust you. And it’s not about being perfect. It’s about being willing to show up, to listen, and to learn.

**Gina Gratza:**
Here’s another top question: “Can any culture be said to ‘own’ psilocybin, since many cultures have used it since antiquity? If psilocybin isn’t owned, what exactly are we at risk of extracting?”

**Joseph Mays:**
That’s a great and complex question.

Ownership itself is a colonial concept — especially when applied to plants or knowledge. In traditional worldviews, nobody owns the plants. But that doesn’t mean we should ignore questions of origin and accountability.

Yes, psilocybin mushrooms grow all over the world. Yes, many different cultures have used them. But we have to be honest: this current psychedelic renaissance wouldn’t exist without the Mazatec people — and without María Sabina, who was exploited and betrayed by Gordon Wasson.

Western psychedelic science — as we know it — has a direct lineage that runs through her. The models we use, the therapy structures we employ, the science we cite — they all come from that thread of extraction.

Even if you're using synthetic psilocybin, you’re still standing on a foundation built through unequal exchange.

**Joseph Mays:**
So what are we at risk of extracting? Not just the molecules — but the relational web that surrounds them. The songs, the language, the ecology, the context. When we take the compound but leave behind the community, the land, the story — that’s the extraction.

And that’s why reciprocity must be broad. It’s not just about royalties or identifying one “owner” community to compensate. At ERI, we don’t frame our work as compensating specific groups for specific medicines. We support diverse Indigenous initiatives based on trust, not ownership.

**Tal Sharabi:**
So it's not a literal act of reciprocity, like paying a specific family. It’s a stance — a relational orientation.

**Joseph Mays:**
Yes. It’s a stance of honoring. It’s about asking: Where does this knowledge come from? Who has been left out? What power dynamics shaped this moment?

And then, giving thanks — through your actions.

The Western model of knowledge puts science at the top. But we need to decenter that. Indigenous perspectives are not just cultural flavor — they’re valid, rigorous ways of knowing. Honoring that means being curious, being humble, and being willing to share power.

**Gina Gratza:**
One more paired question: Can you clarify “ontology”? And do you believe that psychedelics can catalyze a shift toward relational ontology?

**Joseph Mays:**
Ontology is your underlying sense of reality. It’s not just what you know — that’s epistemology. Ontology is the *world* you believe you live in, often unconsciously.

In the dominant Western ontology, plants aren’t sentient. Agency belongs only to humans. Nature is mechanical and mindless.

But in relational ontologies — like many Indigenous frameworks — everything is in relationship. Plants have personhood. Land has memory. Healing is collective.

Can psychedelics shift our ontology? Yes — temporarily. Many people have experiences where they feel connected to everything. But after the journey ends, the default setting returns. Unless we integrate.

Real ontological change happens through daily practice — through how we relate to land, to food, to each other. Psychedelics can open the door. But walking the path — that’s the hard part.
