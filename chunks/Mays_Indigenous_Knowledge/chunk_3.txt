### Opening and Introduction

**Tal Sharabi:**
Hi, everyone. Excited to be here with you today and excited to have Joseph Mays with us. I'm going to introduce him in a bit.

I’ll read from his short bio:

Joseph is an ethnobotanist and anthropologist who studies plant medicines and wisdom traditions. He’s the Program Director of Chacruna’s Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative of the Americas, where he conducts research and builds connections with Indigenous communities across the Americas to support Chacruna’s mission of increasing cultural reciprocity in the psychedelic space.

Joseph has presented at conferences and universities and has published articles exploring plant medicines, Indigenous rights, reciprocity, and biocultural conservation.

It’s good to have you here, Joseph.

**Joseph Mays:**
Thank you so much, everyone. I know maybe you were looking forward to Bia, but I’m coming with her blessings. She doesn’t have COVID, just a bad cold. She’s recovering and feeling better every moment. I’ll do my best to bring Bia’s energy into this.

I started working with Bia three years ago in 2019. I was finishing my ethnobotany degree and met her at Breaking Convention, a conference in London. We've worked closely together ever since.

She approached me with a proposal to develop something that could serve as a way for the psychedelic renaissance — the global north community around psychedelic therapy — to give back to Indigenous communities and the environments and people that have produced this knowledge, which is now being profited from and also hopefully used for healing.

It took a year to develop what we eventually launched: the Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative of the Americas, or ERI. I’ll talk a bit about that. But first, I want to share more about my background — as an ethnobotanist, anthropologist, and ecologist.

**Joseph Mays:**

My supervisor in graduate school was Daniella Peluso, a mentor who’s spent a lifetime in the Amazon with the Sãeha, a group of ayahuasca-using people in Acre — spanning Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru.

She’s taught me so much about working with Indigenous communities, traditional ecological knowledge, and traditional medicinal knowledge.

Ethnobotany is the study of the relationship between people and plants. For me, it's an all-encompassing field — a natural progression from my ethnographic work in cultural anthropology. I studied with highland Maya priests in the mountains of Guatemala. It’s been about ten years since I first traveled there.

I’ve also worked in ecological conservation. I spent time at an ecological reserve and did a lot of regenerative agriculture. Through that, I’ve realized the pursuit of conservation — biodiversity, nature, and the environment — is inextricable from cultural conservation: supporting culture and language.
