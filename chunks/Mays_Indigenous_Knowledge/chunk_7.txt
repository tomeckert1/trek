### Don Ricardo, Language, and Ayahuasca

**Joseph Mays:**
In the 20th century, social scientists began to recognize ideas long present in traditional ecological knowledge systems — like Don Ricardo’s communication with the birds or the Runa story of the jaguar.

Anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro describes this worldview as *perspectivism* — an ontology in which all life is seen as an ecology of subjective selves.

This links to the “ontological turn” in anthropology, which seeks to center non-Western conceptions of reality. It also connects to *multispecies ethnography*, sometimes called “anthropology beyond the human.”

This approach reorganizes the hierarchical binaries that define Western thought — subject/object, nature/culture — and opens the door to engaging with forests as thinking, sentient networks. It sees nature as *minded*, or *mind-manifesting*.

This isn’t just a poetic idea. It’s backed up by emerging research. Plants emit and hear sounds. They store information, learn, plan, and communicate — both with each other and with other species.

### Beyond the Human: Multispecies Ethnography

**Joseph Mays:**
And it’s not just forests. This applies to grasslands, deserts — all ecosystems.

Signification, communication, and meaning-making are not exclusive to humans. This psychedelic point of view — that all life is relational and conscious — can be directly applied to science, medicine, philanthropy, and the way we live.
  
This idea of relational ontology is directly tied to Indigenous medicinal and ecological knowledge.

Empirically, Indigenous and local territories have higher biodiversity than national parks and nature preserves. That’s because Indigenous knowledge systems understand the environment as a living being.

Their management strategies and medicinal practices are both based on a relational worldview — one that acknowledges intelligence in forests, organisms, and even organic compounds.

This stands in contrast to the dominant ontology, which sees subject-object dualism, mind-body separation, and the idea that humans are the only subjects. Within that worldview, Indigenous people have often been treated as part of nature — to be prospected and mined for knowledge, but not respected as knowledge holders.

**Joseph Mays:**
Biomedicine frequently exploits the objective knowledge of traditional practitioners — extracting medicinal compounds — but it rarely honors the epistemologies and ontologies from which that knowledge emerged.

A more holistic approach is possible — one that recognizes plants and their medicinal properties as part of a living community, revealed through interspecies communication, and as sources of both illness and healing.

The contributions of Indigenous knowledge to medicine are immense. Many lucrative drugs have Indigenous origins. For example, the surgical anesthetic curare — specifically *D-tubocurarine* — was isolated from arrow poisons. It revolutionized surgery and deepened our understanding of neuromuscular function.

An old statistic said that 75% of pharmaceuticals with plant-based origins come from Indigenous communities. That number may be even higher today.

Attempts to address this imbalance have mostly focused on intellectual property law. One example is the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), first established at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. This led to the 2010 Nagoya Protocol — a legal mechanism meant to protect Indigenous knowledge.

In theory, the Nagoya Protocol promotes "access and benefit-sharing." But in practice, it’s often used to legitimize biopiracy.
