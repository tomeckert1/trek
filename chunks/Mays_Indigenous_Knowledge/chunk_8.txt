### Biocultural Sovereignty and the Nagoya Protocol

**Joseph Mays:**
The framework assumes a product-oriented market structure. It protects people trying to commercialize and sell products — not the knowledge systems from which those products came.

While there are a few exceptions, most Nagoya agreements do not protect cultural and environmental resources. In some cases, they even facilitate their extraction.

Alternatives exist: liberatory licenses, IP commons, and IP abolition models offer more promise. Nagoya is still a top-down, profit-driven model that reinforces the same colonial power dynamics it claims to solve.

It grants nation-states — often in collaboration with corporate interests — the authority to define and own Indigenous knowledge. This only changes if there is significant Indigenous representation in those governments and corporate structures — something that is still far from reality.
  
The biocultural approach suggests that recognizing personhood in natural systems leads to more effective environmental stewardship.

But it’s important to remember that Indigenous cultures are not monolithic. They have never been static. They cannot be expected to provide solutions to problems created by industrialized nations — especially while bearing the brunt of those consequences.

As land becomes increasingly unavailable, traditional forest gardens often give way to cash crops like coffee. This is Don Ricardo’s son-in-law, Eduardo. He’s showing off his organic coffee, and he’s proud of it. He considers it to be grown as his ancestors would have — even though coffee is not native to the Americas.

Grown on the mountainside without pesticides, fertilizers, or herbicides, Eduardo calls this *permacultura Yánesha*. Permaculture — often presented as a Western innovation — is essentially a repackaging of Indigenous agricultural practices that are regenerative and syntropic.

Eduardo also teaches traditional Yánesha dance and song. He wears the *kushma*, their ceremonial garment, during performances. Part of the coffee production happening in Saco Pen is supported by the ERI program as an agroforestry initiative.

One of Eduardo’s friends put it this way:

> “Many criticize us and tell us that as Yánesha, we must not forget our customs and culture — that we should live in our humble house eating fish and wild animals. But will the Yánesha live from that? Our coffee is now our black gold because it is the only thing that gives us the economic means to survive. We’re in the 21st century. A Yánesha can now be an entrepreneur — but this doesn’t mean we forget our identity. If a brother invites you to drink *masato* — fermented manioc beer — you cannot refuse or be ashamed. It’s part of our culture.”

In the psychedelic and philanthropic spaces, well-meaning people often want to see Indigenous people through a romanticized or convenient lens. But they may not be as attuned to the material realities of the communities they want to support — or the power dynamics at play.
