### Ethnobotany and Ecological Knowledge

**Joseph Mays:**
Effective conservation requires a biocultural approach. Biological and cultural diversity are intertwined. Conservation of nature and biodiversity requires the conservation of human communities.

This principle applies not only to environmental work, but also to healing work — including linguistic, cultural, therapeutic, and societal healing.

I’ll talk about plant uses and traditions, but really, to explore the continuities and discontinuities between Indigenous worlds of sacred plants and Western psychedelic science, we have to understand that the sacred plant world developed within a system of relationship: relationship to land, to life itself. Relationship is the key — ecological, geological, pharmacological — all shaped by culture and by the sense of reality we’re conditioned to have.

I don’t often use the term “Western,” though it can be a stand-in. Sometimes I say “global north.” It’s not really geographic — it's the dominant and hegemonic cultural and economic system rooted in colonialism.

**Joseph Mays:**
Everything — science, medicine, therapy — comes from this legacy. So today we’re going to talk about decolonialism.

One legacy of colonialism is the idea that humans are inherently harmful to the environment — that we contaminate a wilderness that exists separately from us. But historically, we’ve had regenerative relationships with land.

Most of you are probably in Oregon. You likely know the Columbia River — where it joins with the Willamette River in Portland. That whole basin was inhabited by the Chinook people for centuries before Europeans arrived.

It was the most densely populated region in the Pacific Northwest, yet biodiversity was maintained by the Chinook through traditional practices — fishing, hunting, and rotating settlements to allow land to rejuvenate.

### Colonial Legacies and Decolonial Perspectives

**Joseph Mays:**
The national forests around Oregon were shaped by controlled burns and other practices of the original Indigenous inhabitants. Some settlers even copied those practices before they were forgotten — and are now being revitalized.

The idea that wilderness and national parks are untouched by people is a myth. These landscapes were shaped by humans.
  
I'm calling in from Washington, DC, which is in the Chesapeake Bay watershed — another drainage basin formed by the temperate rainforests of the Appalachian Mountains. This is the ancestral land of the Powhatan Nation, a confederation of Algonquin-speaking Indigenous peoples who also shaped their environment through traditional ecological practices.

The oldest mountains in Oregon are tens of millions of years old, but they’re still young compared to the Appalachian Mountains where I am. These mountains were ancient 400 million years ago — before the Atlantic Ocean even existed. They were once a continuous range with the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland, where I spent the first years of my life.
