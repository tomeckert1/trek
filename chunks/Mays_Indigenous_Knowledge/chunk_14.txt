### Final Questions and Closing Remarks

**Scott Yelton (participant):**
Thank you for your talk. I have a marketing question, and I know it might sound off-topic. When promoting this work — say in a 30-second radio ad — should we lead with the science? Like, “It breaks the grip on depression, rewires anxiety.” Or do we say something like, “This is a medicine of connection and relationship”?

**Joseph Mays:**
That’s not a bad question at all, Scott. It’s really important.

It depends on your audience. Some people need the science. They need data, clinical language, credentials — that’s their entry point. And once they’re through the door, their heart may open against their will.

Others are drawn to something deeper — the relational, ancestral message. So you need both. Blend them if you can.

Personally, I’m not a psychedelic evangelist. I don’t think psychedelics are *the* answer. But they’re powerful tools.

The structural issues — inequity, lack of access to basic healthcare — those won’t be fixed by psychedelic therapy alone. Most people can’t afford basic care, let alone psychedelics.

So we need systemic change *and* heart-centered practice. If your heart is in the right place, even a scientific message will carry integrity.

**Carly (participant):**
I come from an academic background — I love epistemology. I imagine some clients will ask about these ontological shifts they experience. How can we, within a clinical framework, meet those questions without imposing belief — but also without erasing the meaning?

**Joseph Mays:**
Beautiful question, Carly.

I’ve seen many practitioners try to remain neutral — to avoid introducing their own worldview into therapy. But the truth is, neutrality is an illusion. If you remove all explicit frameworks, what you’re left with is the dominant ontology — the unexamined worldview of the surrounding culture.

So I encourage people to be transparent. You don’t have to impose anything. But if you’re doing ceremony, if you’re facilitating sacred work, you *do* bring a framework — even if it's implicit.

Some therapists I know — they do their own tobacco offerings before a session, outside, privately. They don’t impose it, but they ground themselves in relationship.

Clients can feel when you are rooted in something real. And when they come back from a psychedelic journey asking about interconnection, about God, about spirits — they don’t want you to deflect. They want you to *receive* what they’ve experienced with respect.

I think what matters is being genuine, being humble, and allowing space for the mystery — without pretending to know all the answers.

**Gina Gratza:**
Beautiful. We’re nearing the end of our time. I know some of you had more questions — please bring them to your home groups or continue the conversation in Moodle.

Joseph, any final thoughts?

**Joseph Mays:**
Just gratitude. Thank you for your attention, your questions, your hearts.

The structures we’re working within are imperfect. But your questions show you’re trying to bridge — between legality and spirit, between therapy and community, between healing and justice.

I believe in that. And I believe in you.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Thank you, Joseph. This was eye-opening and inspiring. Thank you all for showing up with such thoughtful questions and deep listening.

**Tom Eckert:**
Nothing more to add — what a wonderful conversation. Thank you, Joseph, Tal, Gina, and everyone for being here and for the depth you brought.

**Gina Gratza:**
Thank you, Joseph. Relationships — with land, with medicine, with each other — that’s the energy of plant medicine. Thank you for reminding us gently and powerfully.

**Joseph Mays:**
Thank you. Truly.
