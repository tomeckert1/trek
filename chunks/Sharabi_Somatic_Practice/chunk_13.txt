### Why This Matters in Psychedelic Work

**Tal Sharabi:**
Why are we talking about all of this?

**Robin:**
Because we probably go through these waves even while sitting with clients.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes—exactly. These waves exist in the relational field.

**Trevor:**
The bigger the window of tolerance we have, the more we can handle.  
So we should always be working to expand it—for ourselves and others.

**Student:**
And as you mentioned earlier, it's about energy exchange.  
When our client is on the edge, we must hold the safety net—without falling into their process.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes! You just gave the whole next part of the lecture—I love it when that happens.

**Jason Foster:**
Well, we all modulate energy in our own way.  
This morning I didn’t need coffee or my usual ritual—I had a long drive and just had to go.

Some days though, when I’m not looking forward to something, I lean on a ritual:  
Coffee. Maybe two cups.

And that either calms me or spirals me up—depends on the context.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Exactly. We self-medicate with sugar, caffeine, scrolling...  
Modern life is taxing. We’re not wired for this much input.  
We’re all trying to figure it out.

You look like you’ve got something cooking—go ahead.

**Student:**
I do. Just thinking...

**Tal Sharabi:**
Okay, let me check the time—  
We’re good.

We’ll take a break soon, but before that, I want to shift into trauma and the body.
