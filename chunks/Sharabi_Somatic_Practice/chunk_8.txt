### The River of Energy and Flow

**Tal Sharabi:**
You’ll see here a picture of a river. Dan Siegel uses this to describe energy flow. I also like to think of a psilocybin journey as a river. When the channel opens, there’s more flow, more connectivity—more possibility.

As facilitators, part of our role is to help the client navigate that flow.  
How can I, as a facilitator, support the flow that’s opening in my client’s psilocybin journey?

Let’s look at the mind again:
- The mind is emergent.  
- It’s self-organizing.  
- It’s embodied.  
- It’s relational.  
- It regulates energy and information.

So we start to see how the mind and the psyche relate.  
In interpersonal neurobiology, the mind is the process that gives rise to what we think of as the psyche.

The psyche is composed of our awareness, the information moving through us, and how we regulate that movement.

It’s conceptual, I know—but I’m going to shift to something more practical now.
