### Trauma Stored in the Body

**Tal Sharabi:** 
Let’s talk about how trauma gets stuck in the body.

The reason there’s a tiger on this slide is because of Peter Levine.  
He talks about how our primitive brain—especially the amygdala—constantly looks for threats, like a tiger in the bushes.  
When the hippocampus (the part of the brain responsible for memory and context) recognizes there is no threat, we relax. But sometimes, that full completion of the threat response doesn’t happen—and the trauma stays stuck.

Trauma stores in the body in different ways.  
On the *left side of the brain*, it often stores as *implicit memory*—sounds, smells, sensations.  
It’s not stored as a story, and it’s not bound in time. So when triggered, it can feel like it’s happening *right now*, even if it happened years ago.

We can help the body *move* the trauma—*without* needing to go through narrative or meaning-making.  
That’s where somatic therapies come in.
