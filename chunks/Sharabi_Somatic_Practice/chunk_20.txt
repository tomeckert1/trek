### Revisiting the River Metaphor

**Student:**
Can we go back to the river slide? The vertical one.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes. This one?

**Student:**
Yes. So, if I understand, this slide and the horizontal “window” slide are describing the same concept—just differently?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes. The vertical slide (from Dan Siegel) represents how *energy and information* flow through the mind.  
In psychedelic work, I like to think of it like a stream that opens wider during the journey.

Hyperarousal might feel like a *raging river*, while rigidity could be like a *dam or an eddy*—where energy loops without moving.

It’s all a way of understanding what’s happening during psychedelic sessions.

**Student:**
Looking at the horizontal slide again—the window of tolerance is like the *center stream*?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes. And the red zones—hyper and hypo—are like the *edges* of that stream.

**Student:**
So the deeper work happens at those edges?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Exactly.

That’s where the *growth edges* are.  
And yes, sometimes it’s scary—because we spend so much time in the middle of the stream.  
But our role is not to direct the client toward a specific edge.

This is where we return to *non-directiveness*.
