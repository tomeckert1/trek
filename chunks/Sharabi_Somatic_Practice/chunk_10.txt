### Autonomic Nervous System and the Window of Tolerance

**Tal Sharabi:**
Do you remember Emma’s talk on the autonomic nervous system?

We have two branches:
- Sympathetic: associated with action, activation (fight or flight)
- Parasympathetic: associated with rest and digest (calming, restoration)

Within the parasympathetic, we also have:
- Ventral vagal: where social engagement and co-regulation happen  
- Dorsal vagal: associated with freeze or shutdown when activation fails

Emma showed you a graph. Now I want to introduce another model: the *Window of Tolerance*.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Rather than plotting it as a ladder, this model shows a window in the middle:
- *Hyperarousal* (sympathetic): fight or flight  
- *Hypoarousal* (dorsal vagal): freeze or collapse  
- *Window of Tolerance* (ventral vagal): where we regulate, feel safe, and engage

Throughout the day, we modulate—moving within the window.

For example:  

**Tal Sharabi:**
I wake up tired → I drink coffee → I’m more alert.  
Something upsetting happens → I get activated.  
I go for a walk or breathe → I return to center.

That’s modulation. And learning to modulate is part of building resilience.

**Student:**
In terms of modulating, is denial a valid strategy? Can you expand the window of tolerance by just denying the other things—by denying their presence?

**Tal Sharabi:**
That’s a great question.  
Is denial a strategy? Yes—and.

What happens is this:  
The body keeps the score. The mind hides the score.

That’s Bessel van der Kolk.

**Tal Sharabi:**
So what does that mean?

The mind’s job is to help you function.  
In IFS (Internal Family Systems) terms—how many of you are familiar with IFS? (several raise hands)

IFS speaks of "parts." Some parts are designed just to keep us moving forward.  
These are the *managers*. Their job is to negate or suppress the other parts to keep us functioning.

That works—up to a point.

**Tal Sharabi:**
But the body will always remind us when something isn’t right.  
There will always be something that triggers us or pulls us off balance.

When the *window of tolerance* is wide, it means you can handle a lot—you’re resilient, and you can stay within that green zone of regulation.

When the window is narrow, you move quickly from hyperarousal to hypoarousal—and vice versa.  
Some people live at the edges all the time.

Let me show you on this (somewhat visually unpleasant) diagram—those red marks indicate *where trauma work happens*: at the edges of the window.

**Tal Sharabi:**
This is the part I want you to remember.

Trauma work happens at the edges. When clients reach their edge—that’s where transformation can occur.

Sometimes, as trauma therapists or facilitators, we support clients right at that edge. In psychedelic work, the medicine often takes them there.

Our role is to help them ride that line—without letting them fall into overwhelm or collapse.

We don’t want dissociation, but we do want to support that edge-work.
