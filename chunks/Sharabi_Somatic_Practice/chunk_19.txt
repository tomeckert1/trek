### Post-Journey Support and Integration

**Tal Sharabi:**
One more thing about big releases, like rage or catharsis:  
The more overwhelmed a client gets—the more *aftercare* they may need.

Always assess their state *after* the session.

If their nervous system has gone through a big stretch, you’ll need to help them come back.  
You can’t just assume they’re fine.

**Tal Sharabi:**
For example, I had a client—very composed and cerebral—who yelled and made expressive gestures for an hour during his first journey.

He needed *a lot* of support afterward.

It’s like something got stretched wide open very quickly—and we need to help hold that expansion gently as they come back.

This might be:
- Giving them rest time  
- Playing familiar music  
- Letting them look out a window  
- Offering your calm presence  

We’ll talk later about your own nervous system as a facilitator—how that becomes the *relational field* clients come back to.

That’s how we help them *reintegrate* after a big opening or collapse.  
We don’t need them to be perky or party-ready—we just want them to know:  
> “You can move through this. You can come back to yourself.”

**Student:**
What if a client tells you their way of regulating is something they can’t do in session? Like going for a jog or using their phone?

**Tal Sharabi:**
That’s a great question. This is where knowing the client helps.

If they jog to regulate, that tells me *movement* and *embodiment* help them.

So maybe we adapt:
- Gentle stretching  
- Jogging in place  
- Rocking side to side  
- Grounding breath work

You find what works in the room, based on what they’ve told you.
