### Somatic Release and TRE

**Tal Sharabi:**
You may have heard of TRE—*Trauma Release Exercises*.  
This works with the *vagus nerve* and the *autonomic nervous system* to release trauma through natural tremors.

Think of a gazelle escaping a lion. Once the threat is gone, it shakes—letting go of the stored trauma.  

We humans have that same innate ability, but we don’t use it enough.

Sometimes our bodies store *uncompleted responses*—things we *wanted* to do but couldn’t.

**Tal Sharabi:**
For example, if something flies at you and hits you, your body may have wanted to flinch, duck, or protect—but couldn’t. That incomplete impulse can stay stored.

Why am I telling you this?

Because *psychedelics do that*. They bring clients to these places.  
Sometimes not through story—but through body memory and sensation.  

Clients may have intense reactions they don’t understand—and it’s part of the trauma release.

As facilitators, it’s essential to understand this.
