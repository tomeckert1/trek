### Preparation, Resourcing, and Trust

**Megan:**
In this idea of titration—and I agree—when moving into psychedelics, is there a point where you feel like the person has enough internal *resourcing*?

Not from a place of “I have to get this out!” or a chasing trauma state, but from a sense that something in them allows trust in the process? That it’ll be okay, even if more comes up?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes, I completely agree. You’re pointing to something I skipped accidentally.

That’s why I recommend, during *preparation*, you talk to clients about:
- What helps when they feel overwhelmed?
- What do they already do that works?

Then practice some of those tools with them:
- Breathing exercises  
- A mantra  
- A somatic anchor  

We call this *resourcing*.

You’re helping the client develop internal tools for *modulation*—so they can meet difficulty when it arises in the journey.
 
Megan, what are some resourcing practices you teach?

**Megan:**
There’s a whole set of somatic practices I go through with people. It’s less about which exact tool, and more about giving them the *experience* that they can shift themselves.  
It’s that *"I see myself, I can regulate"* experience.

That builds trust—some sense of self. In IFS, it’s like having that inner self-energy—even just a small light of it.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Exactly. That’s the *inner healer*.  
The knowing that *there’s more to me than my pain*.

Every psychedelic journey I’ve facilitated—mushrooms or ketamine—somewhere in there, clients touch that. A moment of warmth. A sense of light. A deep breath.

That’s resourcing. I bring it back in *integration*, and we build on it.

So yes, do it in *preparation*. Help them discover their tools.  

**Tal Sharabi:**
Then during the journey, they can use them.  
And afterward, they’ll have confidence that they can meet the edges of the window.

**Jason Foster:**
Slightly different topic—but can we go back to the *ladder image*?

Sometimes clients come in, and they’re talking fast—agitated, telling stories.  
But something in me senses: there’s something deeper going on.

So I ask:  
> “Can you check in with your body?”

**Jason Foster:**
They find heaviness.  
I say,  
> “Can you follow that heaviness?”

They sink into the couch—and then start crying.

So I wonder if sometimes it’s not about going *up* the ladder, through activation, but instead about *slowing down* and allowing drop-in.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes. What you’re describing is *here*, in that edge space.

They’re in arousal—maybe avoiding grief or sadness.  
Slowing down lets it move.

That’s a good example of *not pushing* toward one end or another.  
Letting the client drop in where they need to go.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Sometimes it’s *not* a full freeze state—but something just beneath the surface.

**Jason Foster:**
And it might be part of a much longer-term process too.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes. I see a few hands. Jason, you’re closest—go ahead.

**student:**
I'm just trying to understand the context of titration more clearly.  
Are you saying we want clients to avoid moving too far outside the window of tolerance—either way?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Exactly. That’s what titration is about.

In psychedelic work, we may not be able to control how far out they go—but we can still track it.  
We can *identify* what’s happening.

And here’s the key point:  
You must *track your client’s nervous system*.  

**Tal Sharabi:**
Pay attention.  

Sometimes, you won’t know if it’s too much until you check.

Say:
> “I’m here.”

Or:
> “I’m here if you need me.”

**Tal Sharabi:**
Or maybe just move a little closer.  
If this is my client, I might sit beside them so they can feel me there.  
That presence alone can be enough.

Sometimes, just *holding a hand* can help a client stay within their edge—without being pushed over.

Your *awareness* and presence make all the difference.

Sometimes, your presence is what makes it safe for a client to move into *extreme rage*—to express something that’s long been suppressed.
