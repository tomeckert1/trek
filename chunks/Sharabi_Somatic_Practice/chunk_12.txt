### Morning Routines and Self-Regulation

**Tal Sharabi:**
Let’s do a quick exercise. Reflect on how you woke up this morning.  
What was your energy like?

(some students smile and nod)

What did you do to modulate? To bring yourself into balance?  
It doesn’t have to be extreme—just notice the small things you did.

**Student:**
I have a really hard time with transitions—waking up and shifting from sleep to being awake is tough for me.  
So every morning, even if I don’t need it, I take a shower. It’s my ritual.  
It helps me process the transition and the stimuli of being awake.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yeah. That’s a great example.  
And when you wake up overwhelmed, does it put you down?

**Student:**
Totally. But the shower wakes me up too. It calms me down if I’m activated.  
It’s a good time to center myself, depending on where I’m at.  
Sometimes I sit and regulate, other times I dance with upbeat music.  
The water keeps me in my body—it’s sensory. I stay present.

**Tal Sharabi:**
You’re really paying attention to yourself. You’re tuning in:  
What do I need right now?

And that’s a ritual. You’re showing up to your life with care.  
I call my morning ritual "dusting myself off."

**Another Student:**
On the other side of that spectrum, I stare at my phone.  
I know it’s not a great practice—I even deleted Instagram.  
But it helps regulate something in me.  
It’s like a trance state.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Right. That’s a great observation.  
It might be effective in the moment, or it might be a way of *negating* emotion.  
The body will still remind us when something is unresolved.
