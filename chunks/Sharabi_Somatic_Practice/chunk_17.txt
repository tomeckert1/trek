### Titration and the Pickle Jar

**Tal Sharabi:**
What is titration?

It’s a concept from somatic trauma healing.  
Imagine a jar of pickles. You don’t eat the whole pickle—you slice *a very fine piece*. That’s titration.

In regular therapy, we work in small, digestible slices to keep clients within their window.

But in *psychedelic work*, we don’t get to choose the size of the slice.  
Right, Jason?

**Jason Foster:**
Right.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Exactly. So every time I give a client psilocybin, I enter into *trust*:
- Trust in the container.  
- Trust in the safety we’ve built.  
- Trust in the client’s wisdom.  
- Trust in the process.  
- Trust in my ability to support modulation.

Titration still matters—we may guide them to regulate.  
But the intensity isn’t always ours to choose. That’s part of the sacred responsibility.

So... that’s the first part of today’s session.

How’s it landing for you?
