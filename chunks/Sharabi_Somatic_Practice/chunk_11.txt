### A Story of Transformation at the Edge

**Tal Sharabi:**
Let me share an example:

A client of mine—actually, someone I supported through integration—took 7 grams of psilocybin alone, with just a friend present.

She lay on the floor, feeling kidnapped, unable to move. She felt the full weight of her depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma—just lying there for hours.

Eventually, something clicked. She thought: “I have nothing to lose.”

She pulled herself up. She almost broke the window.

Do you see how that shows the movement?

**Tal Sharabi:**
She went from immobilization to activation—she accessed the part of herself that could *stand up*, *move*, *wake up from depression*.

That’s what the medicine helped her find. That’s what we can help support in session.

**Megan:**
Thank you for that. I just felt a little confused by the diagram—why is social engagement in the middle? I don’t disagree, I just usually see it as more overarching, building resilience over time and reducing reactivity.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Great point. Both perspectives are true.

This diagram shows the *evolutionary hierarchy*—how you may need to move into sympathetic activation (fight/flight) before exiting freeze.

The other diagram—Emma’s—shows a wave: normal modulation across the day. That’s healthy regulation.

Both describe the same system—just different functions.

**Robin:**
Is it healthy to dip into freeze regularly?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Not really. The wave occurs mostly *within* the window—the green zone.

Going into hyperarousal regularly means you're having anxiety attacks. Going into hypoarousal regularly means you're experiencing depression or shutdown.

**Student:**
So, just to clarify, in regular life we mostly operate in the green zone?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes. That’s where we function. But many of us know those dips—some days we're low, and we need to go for a walk, meditate, or breathe to return to center.
