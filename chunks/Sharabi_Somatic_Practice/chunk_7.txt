### Dan Siegel and Interpersonal Neurobiology

**Tal Sharabi:**
Dan Siegel is someone I love to reference. He's both a researcher and a clinician. He developed the framework of interpersonal neurobiology by integrating different scientific perspectives.

He’s a psychiatrist and a neurobiologist, and he describes how energy and information flow through the organs of the body—neurons firing, pathways forming, the nervous system at work.

**Tal Sharabi:**
The mind is the regulatory process—it navigates and regulates the energy and information. The mind is emergent.

It also includes subjective experience.

So when we talk about the "mind," we include subjective experience, biological functioning, and interpersonal relationships. Relationships are how energy and information are shared and communicated.

Dan Siegel sees energy as the life force integral to mental activity, emotional expression, and bodily sensation.

Can you feel the energy within you right now?  
Can you feel the information moving through your body?  

**Tal Sharabi:**
That movement, and your awareness of it—that’s your mind at work.

Even though we’re not speaking it aloud, there’s communication happening between us right now.

I love this perspective. It pairs so well with psychedelic work—it helps us conceptualize what’s happening.

“Energy flows where attention goes.”  
This means the nervous system isn’t just a container of data. It’s an active participant in energy exchange—within ourselves and in relationship.
