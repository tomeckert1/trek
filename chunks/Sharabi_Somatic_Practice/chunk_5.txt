### Why Psychedelic Work Requires Embodiment

**Tal Sharabi:**
We're going to explore why psychedelics require embodiment.

The first part of this talk is more didactic—to get us all on the same page with this perspective. It's also a continuation of Emma’s talk, bringing it into another layer of practical depth. You'll see that unfold as I move into the second part.

We’ll discuss attunement, presence, and co-regulation.  
And in the middle, I’ll talk about interpersonal neurobiology—why it’s important to see the mind, brain, and relationship as the elements we’re working with when supporting a client.

**Tal Sharabi:**
So, emergent healing modalities. Psychedelics are emergent healing. So are somatic practices. IFS is emergent.

What is "emergent"?

It’s holistic. It’s integrative. It views the person as a whole.  
We're recognizing the interconnectedness in the system—psychological, biological, neurological. It's relationship-focused.

And it’s process-oriented. The present moment is key—because that’s where process happens. Attention to the here and now gives us something to work with.

We're not pathologizing. We're bringing embodiment.

This is where we return to that poem about the inner healer.  
We trust. We trust the person's inner wisdom to surface when the right conditions and tools are present.

It’s also self-organizing. This relates to the psyche's innate wisdom—its emergent and self-organizing nature.
