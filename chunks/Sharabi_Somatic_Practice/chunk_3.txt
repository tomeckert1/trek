### Opening Remarks and Poem

**Jason Foster:**
Hi.  
Welcome to Intensive Four.  

We're going to talk about some advanced facilitation material today. Tal's going to lead us through some somatic practices. I’ll dive into neurobiology and the underworld journey, and we’ll make space for role plays too. I think it's going to be fun—though some parts may feel a little heavy.

Let’s begin by connecting with gratitude. Maybe close your eyes and connect to something you feel grateful for. Just feel that in your body, in your heart. Let that feel good. And when you're ready, expand your attention outward. Maybe blink your eyes a few times. Take a look around at your fellow students. Maybe make some eye contact.  

Yeah. Welcome.  

**Jason Foster:**
I'm grateful for the opportunity to be here and do this.

Before I hand the mic to Tal, I want to read a poem I wrote while working with a client:

> Your inner healer is not just psychological,  
> not just your wise self that can love all the parts of yourself and everyone else.  
>  
> Your inner healer is not just the one who knows that sometimes healing  

**Jason Foster:**
> does not mean fixing something, but rather embracing it.  
>  
> Your inner healer is also your body.  
> It is in your tears and your spit and your sweat.  
> It is in the breath that fills you up with life.  
> It is in the caress you give your tired, injured body.  

**Jason Foster:**
>  
> It is in the kicking, and screaming, and shaking,  
> in rhythmic movements, in the stillness, in reaching for others,  
> in the movement of your hands that brush away the sticky darkness  
> that has accompanied you for so long.  
>  

**Jason Foster:**
> Your inner healer has its own timeline, its own wisdom,  
> that does not always align with your shoulds and wants.  
>  
> Your inner healer has the patience to pull out ten thousand splinters,  
> one at a time, kissing each wound with tenderness and gratitude.  
>  

**Jason Foster:**
> Your inner healer knows the way through the underworld  
> and carries the dowsing rod that will lead you to the waters of life.  
>  
> Your inner healer knows that the earth can take your grief and pain  
> and knows that the light of the cosmos is always shining on you  
> and is orchestrating your healing to open toward that light.  

Thank you.
