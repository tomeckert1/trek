### Trauma Work and the Window Edge

**Tal Sharabi:**
So now let’s bring this back to the *Window of Tolerance*.

Psychedelic work often brings clients *to the edge* of their window.  
Not always—but sometimes.

How can we help them *stay with* that edge, without falling into collapse or overwhelm?

**Tal Sharabi:**
That’s our role. To be present. To pay attention. To help titrate and regulate.  
To assess:  
- Do they need my nervous system to co-regulate?  
- Or are they okay riding that edge a bit longer?

Because that’s where *resolution* can happen.

I’ll give you a visual metaphor now: the *pickle jar*.
