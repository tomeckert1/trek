## Non-Directive Support and Closing Reflections

**Tal Sharabi:**
As facilitators, we don’t need to push clients toward specific content or outcomes.

We trust that the *medicine and the client* will take themselves where they need to go.  
Our job is to *create safety*, so it’s okay for them to explore *whatever arises*.

This relationship exists in *every moment* of the session.

**Student:**
I like that you tie it back to the river.  
Maybe *rigidity* is like a dam—blocking the life force—and *fight or flight* is like a flood that breaks the dam. That rush can be what’s needed to move through freeze.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes, exactly. That’s a powerful image.

*Rumination*, for instance, is a form of rigidity—it’s looping.  
It keeps us stuck, repeating the same thoughts.

But the medicine can bring a wave of movement—something that breaks the loop and lets the energy flow again.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Okay... I’m a bit over time.

Let’s take a break now.  
Please come back at *11:15*.  
In the second part, we’ll shift focus to the *facilitator’s own nervous system*—how you hold yourself and support co-regulation in the session.

Thank you, everyone.
