### Transition to Somatic Teaching

**Tal Sharabi:**
Hi.  
I haven’t been here for a while—it’s good to see your faces in person.  

Thank you.  

Okay, before I begin, I just want to name that my nervous system is a little taxed today.  
I was nervous to come here and talk, and I'm a little shaky. So I just want to name that, to help bring myself into presence more fully.

**Tal Sharabi:**
Today, I’m going to talk about something that’s my favorite thing. It’s what I do—and honestly, if I could quit everything else, I’d just do this.  

Working with the innate wisdom of the body.

There’s a growing awareness in the field of psychedelics around embodiment. It started already with the Mithoefers—Annie Mithoefer and her work with Hakomi. Others carry different kinds of somatic wisdom too, and these methods work so well with psychedelics.

I bring this to you because I feel it's such an important embodied practice, one we can all share. With us, this can ripple into our collective wisdom—into how we hold the medicine.

Before I start, a note of care: I’ll be talking about the body. We all have different relationships with our bodies on any given day. As I said, today I’m a little off. So just be kind to yourself. Be gentle. If anything I offer doesn’t feel good or if you don’t want to dive deep today, that’s okay. Take care of yourself.
