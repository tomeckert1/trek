### Chaos and Rigidity: The Edges of the River

**Tal Sharabi:**
In this framework, we move between chaos and rigidity. The goal is balance.

This relates to what we’ll soon talk about—the nervous system and the window of tolerance. But first, think about it this way:

- Rigidity is when we don’t allow flow.  

**Tal Sharabi:**
  We may hold too much, or have repetitive patterns of thought.  

- Chaos is when energy becomes disorganized or overwhelming.

In day-to-day life, we try to find balance between these states.  
In psychedelic sessions, that navigation can look a bit different.

**Student:**
Are you saying chaos causes rigidity? Or is rigidity a kind of protective response to chaos?

**Tal Sharabi:**
Yes—sometimes rigidity is a response to chaos. It's a strategy for safety when there’s too much happening. But the real balance isn’t in either extreme—it’s in the flow between them.

That’s integration. That’s regulation.
