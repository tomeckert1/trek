### Substance Use and Withdrawal*

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Key concerns:*
- *Sobriety at time of session* — intoxication impairs consent and cooperation.
- *Withdrawal risks* — particularly from:
  - Alcohol
  - Opiates
  - Benzodiazepines

*Withdrawal symptoms include:*
- High blood pressure
- High heart rate
- Confusion
- Seizures

*Action:*
Assess both recent use and potential withdrawal risks. Do not serve a client actively intoxicated or in acute withdrawal.
