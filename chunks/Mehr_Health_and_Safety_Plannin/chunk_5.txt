### The Intake Process Overview

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
Here’s generally how the intake and screening process works:

*Step 1: Exploratory Call*
- A brief call to get to know the client and assess basic fit.
- Ask: *"Are there any major health issues?"*
- Identify the "Big Three" early:
  - *Lithium use* (past 30 days)
  - *History of psychosis*
  - *Current thoughts of harming self or others*

If any of the "Big Three" are present → *Legally prohibited* from psilocybin services.

*Step 2: Detailed Intake Forms*
- After the exploratory call, if no red flags:
  - Client completes a *health intake form* (your own, or the service center's).
- Thoroughly *read and review* all health information.

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
If unfamiliar conditions arise:
- *Research* the condition (ask the client, consult reliable sources).
- *Obtain a consult* if there’s any concern.
- *Pause* before proceeding if a concern arises.

*Step 3: Consultations and Safety Planning*
- Consults may involve:
  - Client’s primary care physician
  - Mental health providers
  - Psychedelic-informed consultants

You’re aiming to:
- Understand risks clearly
- Create a *customized safety plan*
- Make sure *everyone is informed* and agrees before proceeding
