### Additional Medical Considerations

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Mobility and Fall Risk*
- Dizziness and balance issues can *worsen under psilocybin*.
- Fall risk rises, especially during bathroom trips or position changes.
- Blood thinners amplify risk (e.g., internal bleeding from a fall).

*Facilitation actions:*
- Have mobility aids (canes, walkers) on hand.
- Offer support during standing/walking transitions.
- Plan pathways and bathroom access carefully.

*Pregnancy and Lactation*
- *Pregnancy:*
*Facilitation actions:*
  - No robust data on psilocybinâ€™s safety.
  - Theoretical risks: 
    - Impact on fetal serotonin systems.
    - Risk of miscarriage from emotional/physical stress.

- *Breastfeeding:*
  - Psilocin (active form) likely appears in breast milk.
*Facilitation actions:*
  - Likely clears within *48 hours* after dosing.

*OHA Guidance:*
- Inform clients of the unknown risks.
- Recommended: *Pump and discard breastmilk for 48 hours post-session*.
