### Special Populations and Considerations

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)*
- Paralysis can cause:
  - Changes in serotonin receptors
  - Painful spasms triggered by psilocybin
  - Exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses

*Facilitation considerations:*
- How will the client transfer safely?
- Catheterization needs?
- Plan for incontinence?
- Autonomic dysregulation risks?

Detailed preparation and client-specific support plan are critical.

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Eye and Intracranial Pressure Concerns*

- *Angle-Closure Glaucoma:*
  - Increased eye pressure = danger of *sudden blindness*.
  - Early signs: Eye pain and redness.

- *Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP):*
  - E.g., brain tumors, VP shunts.
  - Risk of worsening symptoms with psilocybin-induced blood pressure spikes.

Any hint of eye or brain pressure issues → *Pause and seek medical clearance*.

*Liver Disease*
- Psilocybin is metabolized in the liver.
- Severe liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis) may cause:
  - Delayed onset
  - Prolonged or intensified effects

Investigate liver health carefully.

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Diabetes (Especially Insulin-Dependent)*
- Risks:
  - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
  - High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
  - Inability to manage insulin during session

*Special Case:*
- Clients with insulin pumps who are suicidal pose a very high risk (e.g., ability to self-administer dangerous insulin doses).

Must plan for blood sugar monitoring and insulin management during session.

*Addison’s Disease*
- Adrenal gland disorder — body can’t produce enough stress hormones.
- Risks:
  - Addisonian crisis during emotional/physical stress (like a journey)
  - Needs pre-planned *steroid support protocols*.

Any client with significant medical conditions affecting mobility, metabolism, or stress responses needs *advance planning* and *realistic facilitator evaluation* of scope and comfort.
