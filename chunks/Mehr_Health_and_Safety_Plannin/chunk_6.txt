### Quick Note on the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) Client Form

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
The OHA Client Information Form requires facilitators to:
- *Exclude* clients if they say YES to lithium, psychosis, or active harm thoughts.
- *Encourage* clients to seek a consult for medical, mental, or behavioral conditions (not required, but encouraged).
- *Provide risk disclosures* for pregnancy or breastfeeding.
- *Coordinate safety plans* for mobility or communication needs.
- *Consider* substance use, trauma history, and past altered states in your planning and facilitator matching.

### Organ Systems Affected by Psilocybin

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
Let’s zoom out and look at the *main organ systems* psilocybin impacts.  
If a client has conditions affecting these systems, it's time to *pause* and *investigate*.

1. *Stomach*
- Psilocybin enters through the stomach.
- *Nausea and vomiting* are common.
- Not usually a safety concern, but good to prepare for.

2. *Heart*
- Increases heart rate and blood pressure.
- Be cautious with clients with:
  - Coronary artery disease
  - History of heart attacks
  - Heart valve problems
  - Aneurysms
  - Heart rhythm problems (like A-fib or SVT)

If the heart is structurally or electrically fragile → *Consult required*.

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
3. *Brain (Neurologic)*
- Affects cognition, emotions, perceptions.
- Key concerns:
  - *Stroke history* (risk from elevated blood pressure)
  - *Cognitive impairment* (e.g., dementia, TBI)
    - Especially concerning for *decision-making capacity* and *consent*.

4. *Serotonin System*
- Psilocybin acts as a *partial serotonin agonist*.
- Important when considering *medication interactions* (more detail coming in later lecture).

5. *Liver*
- Psilocybin is *metabolized in the liver*.
- Clients with *severe liver disease* (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis) may have:
  - Delayed onset
  - Prolonged effects
  - Potentially more intense experiences

> *You don’t have to diagnose or memorize conditions!*  
> When a red flag pops up, *pause* and *consult* to make an informed plan.
