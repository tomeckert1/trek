### Dissociative Disorders

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Key concerns:*
- Includes *Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)* and less severe dissociation.
- Risks:
  - *Fragmentation of ego structures* may worsen.
  - Consent complications — ensuring all "alters" agree is ethically murky.
  - Potential for persistent dissociation post-session.

*Important caveats:*
- No robust clinical trials — individuals with dissociative disorders are typically excluded.
- Differing opinions:
  - Some practitioners believe psychedelics can *help*.
  - Risks of worsening fragmentation remain *unclear*.

*Action:*
Exercise *extreme caution*. Ensure support systems are robust if proceeding at all.
