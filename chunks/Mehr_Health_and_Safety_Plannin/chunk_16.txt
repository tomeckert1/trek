### Suicidality

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*OHA Rules:*
- Active suicidal ideation with plan or intent = *automatic exclusion*.

*Nuances:*
- *Passive suicidal thoughts* (e.g., “I wish I wouldn’t wake up”) ≠ automatic disqualifier.
- Important distinctions:
  - Passive vs. active suicidality
  - Strength of suicidal intent
  - Existing safety plans and therapist engagement

*Risk considerations:*
- Unrealistic expectations ("this is my last hope") can *amplify* post-session despair if not met.
- Experiences during sessions (e.g., loss of fear of death) may *lower inhibition* against suicide afterward.

*Action:*
- Deep screening is essential.
- Require strong support systems (therapist, psychiatrist, family).
- Delay sessions if active risk factors are present.
