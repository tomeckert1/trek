### Psilocybin and Neurologic Considerations

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Stroke and TIA (Mini-Strokes)*

- *High blood pressure* from psilocybin could increase risk of:
  - Stroke
  - Mini-stroke (Transient Ischemic Attack - TIA)

If there's a history → *Pause and investigate*.

*Cognitive Impairment*
- Includes:
  - Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
  - Dementia
  - Severe Autism Spectrum

Why it matters:
- *Consent* is the biggest concern.
- Clients must:
  - Understand what psilocybin is
  - Understand the risks
  - Make an informed decision

If their cognitive impairment prevents this → serious ethical concern.
