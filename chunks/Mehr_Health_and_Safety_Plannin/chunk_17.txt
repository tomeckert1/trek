### Trauma, PTSD, and Psilocybin

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
*Key points:*
- Psilocybin may help trauma healing.
- Risk of *re-traumatization* if unresolved trauma resurfaces suddenly.
- Facilitators must have appropriate trauma-informed training and experience.

Ensure trauma clients are matched to facilitators with *specialized skills*.  
Lack of preparation = increased risk of psychological harm.
