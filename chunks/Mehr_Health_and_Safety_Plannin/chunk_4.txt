### Defining "Safety"

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
When I talk about safety, Iâ€™m referring to:
- *Client safety*
- *Facilitator safety* (you)

*Other Contextual Points:*
- *Facility safety* (service center liability)
- *Sustainability of the movement* (avoiding negative headlines that could slow legalization)

Understanding your *scope of practice* is critical:
- Safety standards must match your personal competence and comfort level.
