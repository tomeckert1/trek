### Welcome and Introduction

**Elyse Gardner:**
Hi, everyone. Good evening.

We are so privileged to have our Health and Safety Director of InnerTrek with us tonight.

He’s all things health and safety — all of your questions around health and safety, he's here for them. He's also a facilitator and the owner of Cascade Psychedelic Medicine here in Portland.

Seth is very knowledgeable, very wise, and like I said, he'll introduce himself a little bit more. So I'll just hand over the mic.

Whenever you're ready, Seth.

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
Alright. Thanks, Elyse. I appreciate it. Thank you, Lisa.

Hello, everybody. Glad to be here.

Introducing myself:  
I started my medicine career as an emergency room doctor. I worked for twenty years at St. Vincent's up on the west side of Portland.

I have experience treating medical emergencies, mental health emergencies, complications from drug use, mania, psychosis, suicidality, serotonin syndrome, seizures, heart attacks, strokes — all those theoretical conditions we talk about when we talk about health and safety.

I graduated from InnerTrek’s first cohort. I've been facilitating groups at InnerTrek since the beginning.

My role as Health and Safety Director is to screen and review all of the applications for clients coming through InnerTrek and to talk about eligibility and safety planning.

I also run Cascade Psychedelic Medicine. I started that about four years ago, where I do ketamine work. I've facilitated thousands of ketamine sessions and have had mentorship from Ben Malcolm — many of you may know Spirit Pharmacist Ben — who has been really helpful for me as well.

I'm excited to be here and share.

### Goals and Context of the Talk

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
Before we really jump into the meat of the talk, let's review the goals.

The goals for this talk are to:
- Introduce the process of screening and safety planning.
- Familiarize you with the most relevant conditions and circumstances central to health and safety in psilocybin services.

*Learning Expectations:*
You do *not* need to memorize:
- Specific medical conditions
- Mental health diagnoses
- Specific types of safety plans

As facilitators, you will have opportunities to consult:
- Health and Safety Directors (like me)
- Mental health specialists
- Primary care doctors
- Therapists
- Other consultants

Based on those consultations, you will help put together appropriate safety plans.  

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
It’s really more important to understand *when to obtain a consultation*, *how to navigate barriers*, *how to approach safety planning*, and *how to feel comfortable with your client*.

*Recognizing Different Backgrounds:*
I recognize there’s a broad array of backgrounds here:
- Some of you are medical professionals.
- Some of you have no medical background at all.

This talk is an *introduction* — a *foundation*.

We are planning to offer a *continuing education course* in the future, geared toward higher levels of medical safety planning and screening for those interested.

*Tonight's Talk is Part 1 of 2:*
Later in the course, I'll give a second talk covering:
- Medication interactions
- Adverse events
- Recognizing and managing emergencies and complications
- Psilocybin is generally very safe.
- It has a long history of safe use.
- It is very powerful — and in some cases, can be harmful.

It is our responsibility to:
- Be aware of higher-risk situations.
- Minimize potential harm.
- Sometimes decline services if needed.
- Plan appropriately: matching clients with facilitators, adjusting medications, involving support people, and having emergency plans in place.

*Important to Recognize:*
- While rare, there are reports of adverse events: suicides, psychosis, spiritual emergencies, heart attacks, death.
- The numbers are low, but the risks are real.
- Learning how to navigate these risks is part of our professional responsibility.

**Dr. Seth Mehr:**
Alright, with that context, Elise, let’s move to the next slide.

Major Topics for Tonight
  
Let's go over the major topics we'll cover tonight:
- What the screening process actually looks like
- Brief review of the main effects of psilocybin
- Key medical and psychiatric considerations

*Important Qualification:*
There isn’t a lot of robust safety data out there.  
- Many psilocybin clinical trials *exclude* people with a lot of conditions.
- This limits our ability to predict risks with great certainty.

*Other Contextual Points:*
- Psilocybin is *not FDA approved*.
- There is *no gold standard* side effects list.
- Different programs (Oregon, Colorado, etc.) have *different standards*.
- Legal frameworks matter — we must always practice within the context of the law.

Screening and eligibility involve a *tradeoff*:

*Other Contextual Points:*
- *Access* vs. *Safety*
- It’s about offering services to as many people as possible — while ensuring safety is not compromised.
